[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, with others.]

Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in
Another moon. But, O, methinks how slow
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires
Like to a stepdame or a dowager
Long withering out a young man's revenue.

Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.

THESEUS  Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword
And won thy love doing thee injuries,
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.

[Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, and Lysander 
 and Demetrius.]

Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!

Thanks, good Egeus. What's the news with thee?

Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.--
Stand forth, Demetrius.--My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.--
Stand forth, Lysander.--And, my gracious duke,
This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.--
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes
And interchanged love tokens with my child.
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
With feigning voice verses of feigning love
And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats--messengers
Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.
With cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart,
Turned her obedience (which is due to me)
To stubborn harshness.--And, my gracious duke,
Be it so she will not here before your Grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
As she is mine, I may dispose of her,
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.

What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid.
To you, your father should be as a god,
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted, and within his power
To leave the figure or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

So is Lysander.

THESEUS  In himself he is,
But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
The other must be held the worthier.

I would my father looked but with my eyes.

Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.

I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
But I beseech your Grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

Either to die the death or to abjure
Forever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether (if you yield not to your father's choice)
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,
But earthlier happy is the rose distilled
Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,
Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.

So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
Unto his Lordship whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

Take time to pause, and by the next new moon
(The sealing day betwixt my love and me
For everlasting bond of fellowship),
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.

Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right.

You have her father's love, Demetrius.
Let me have Hermia's. Do you marry him.

Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;
And what is mine my love shall render him.
And she is mine, and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.

LYSANDER, [to Theseus]
I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
As well possessed. My love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly ranked
(If not with vantage) as Demetrius';
And (which is more than all these boasts can be)
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

I must confess that I have heard so much,
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
But, being overfull of self-affairs,
My mind did lose it.--But, Demetrius, come,
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.
I have some private schooling for you both.--
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
To fit your fancies to your father's will,
Or else the law of Athens yields you up
(Which by no means we may extenuate)
To death or to a vow of single life.--
Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?--
Demetrius and Egeus, go along.
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.

With duty and desire we follow you.
[All but Hermia and Lysander exit.]

How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?

Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.

Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth.
But either it was different in blood--

O cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.

Or else misgraffed in respect of years--

O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.

Or else it stood upon the choice of friends--

O hell, to choose love by another's eyes!

Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
Making it momentany as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth,
And, ere a man hath power to say "Behold!"
The jaws of darkness do devour it up.
So quick bright things come to confusion.

If then true lovers have been ever crossed,
It stands as an edict in destiny.
Then let us teach our trial patience
Because it is a customary cross,
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.

A good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia:
I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Of great revenue, and she hath no child.
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,
And she respects me as her only son.
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then
Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night,
And in the wood a league without the town
(Where I did meet thee once with Helena
To do observance to a morn of May),
There will I stay for thee.

HERMIA  My good Lysander,
I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen
When the false Trojan under sail was seen,
By all the vows that ever men have broke
(In number more than ever women spoke),
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.

Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.


Godspeed, fair Helena. Whither away?

Call you me "fair"? That "fair" again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!
Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue's sweet air
More tunable than lark to shepherd's ear
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Sickness is catching. O, were favor so!
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet
melody.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look and with what art
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart!

I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

O, that your frowns would teach my smiles such
skill!

I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

O, that my prayers could such affection move!

The more I hate, the more he follows me.

The more I love, the more he hateth me.

His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

None but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!

Take comfort: he no more shall see my face.
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see
Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell
That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!

Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.
Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass,
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
(A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal),
Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.

And in the wood where often you and I
Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
There my Lysander and myself shall meet
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes
To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.--
Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.

I will, my Hermia.	[Hermia exits.]
Helena, adieu.
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
[Lysander exits.]

How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.
He will not know what all but he do know.
And, as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities.
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity.
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste.
Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is Love said to be a child
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.
For, ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne,
He hailed down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and show'rs of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight.
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night
Pursue her. And, for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.

[Enter Helen with a paper, and Fool.]

HELEN  My mother greets me kindly. Is she well?

FOOL  She is not well, but yet she has her health. She's
very merry, but yet she is not well. But, thanks be
given, she's very well and wants nothing i' th' world,
but yet she is not well.

HELEN  If she be very well, what does she ail that she's
not very well?

FOOL  Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.

HELEN  What two things?

FOOL  One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send
her quickly; the other, that she's in Earth, from
whence God send her quickly.


PAROLLES  Bless you, my fortunate lady.

HELEN  I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine
own good fortunes.

PAROLLES  You had my prayers to lead them on, and to
keep them on have them still.--O my knave, how
does my old lady?

FOOL  So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I
would she did as you say.

PAROLLES  Why, I say nothing.

FOOL  Marry, you are the wiser man, for many a man's
tongue shakes out his master's undoing. To say
nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to
have nothing is to be a great part of your title,
which is within a very little of nothing.

PAROLLES  Away. Thou 'rt a knave.

FOOL  You should have said, sir, "Before a knave,
thou 'rt a knave"; that's "Before me, thou 'rt a
knave." This had been truth, sir.

PAROLLES  Go to. Thou art a witty fool. I have found

FOOL  Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you
taught to find me?

PAROLLES  ...

FOOL  The search, sir, was profitable, and much fool
may you find in you, even to the world's pleasure
and the increase of laughter.

PAROLLES  A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
Madam, my lord will go away tonight;
A very serious business calls on him.
The great prerogative and rite of love,
Which as your due time claims, he does acknowledge
But puts it off to a compelled restraint,
Whose want and whose delay is strewed with sweets,
Which they distill now in the curbed time
To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
And pleasure drown the brim.

HELEN  What's his will else?

That you will take your instant leave o' th' King
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
Strengthened with what apology you think
May make it probable need.

HELEN  What more commands he?

That, having this obtained, you presently
Attend his further pleasure.

In everything I wait upon his will.

PAROLLES  I shall report it so.	[Parolles exits.]

HELEN, [to Fool]  I pray you, come, sirrah.

[Enter Countess and Steward, with a paper.]

Alas! And would you take the letter of her?
Might you not know she would do as she has done
By sending me a letter? Read it again.

STEWARD [reads the letter]
	I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone.
	   Ambitious love hath so in me offended
	That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
	   With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
	Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
	   My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.
	Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
	   His name with zealous fervor sanctify.
	His taken labors bid him me forgive;
	   I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
	From courtly friends, with camping foes to live
	   Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.
	He is too good and fair for death and me,
	Whom I myself embrace to set him free.

Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much
As letting her pass so. Had I spoke with her,
I could have well diverted her intents,
Which thus she hath prevented.

STEWARD  Pardon me, madam.
If I had given you this at overnight,
She might have been o'erta'en. And yet she writes
Pursuit would be but vain.

COUNTESS  What angel shall
Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
To this unworthy husband of his wife.
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
He will return; and hope I may that she,
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
Is dearest to me, I have no skill in sense
To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak.
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

[Enter one of the French Lords, with five or six other
Soldiers in ambush.]

LORD  He can come no other way but by this hedge
corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible
language you will. Though you understand it
not yourselves, no matter. For we must not seem to
understand him, unless some one among us whom
we must produce for an interpreter.

FIRST SOLDIER  Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.

LORD  Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy
voice?

FIRST SOLDIER  No, sir, I warrant you.

LORD  But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to
us again?

FIRST SOLDIER  E'en such as you speak to me.

LORD  He must think us some band of strangers i' th'
adversary's entertainment. Now, he hath a smack
of all neighboring languages. Therefore we must
every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know
what we speak one to another. So we seem to know
is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
gabble enough and good enough. As for
you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But
couch, ho! Here he comes to beguile two hours in
a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he
forges.	[They move aside.]


PAROLLES  Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill
be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
done? It must be a very plausive invention that
carries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces
have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the
fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not
daring the reports of my tongue.

LORD, [aside]  This is the first truth that e'er thine own
tongue was guilty of.

PAROLLES  What the devil should move me to undertake
the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant
of the impossibility and knowing I had no such
purpose? I must give myself some hurts and say I
got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it.
They will say "Came you off with so little?" And
great ones I dare not give. Wherefore? What's the
instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman's
mouth and buy myself another of
Bajazeth's mule if you prattle me into these perils.

LORD, [aside]  Is it possible he should know what he is,
and be that he is?

PAROLLES  I would the cutting of my garments would
serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish

LORD, [aside]  We cannot afford you so.

PAROLLES  Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was
in stratagem.

LORD, [aside]  'Twould not do.

PAROLLES  Or to drown my clothes and say I was
stripped.

LORD, [aside]  Hardly serve.

PAROLLES  Though I swore I leapt from the window of
the citadel--

LORD, [aside]  How deep?

PAROLLES  Thirty fathom.

LORD, [aside]  Three great oaths would scarce make
that be believed.

PAROLLES  I would I had any drum of the enemy's. I
would swear I recovered it.

LORD, [aside]  You shall hear one anon.

PAROLLES  A drum, now, of the enemy's--
[Alarum within.]

LORD, [advancing]  Throca movousus, cargo, cargo,
cargo.

ALL  Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.
[They seize him.]

PAROLLES  O ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.
[They blindfold him.]

FIRST SOLDIER  Boskos thromuldo boskos.

I know you are the Muskos' regiment,
And I shall lose my life for want of language.
If there be here German or Dane, Low Dutch,
Italian, or French, let him speak to me.
I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.

FIRST SOLDIER  Boskos vauvado, I understand thee and
can speak thy tongue. Kerelybonto, sir, betake thee
to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy

PAROLLES  O!

FIRST SOLDIER  O, pray, pray, pray! Manka reuania
dulche.

LORD  Oscorbidulchos voliuorco.

The General is content to spare thee yet
And, hoodwinked as thou art, will lead thee on
To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
Something to save thy life.

PAROLLES  O, let me live,
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that
Which you will wonder at.

FIRST SOLDIER  But wilt thou faithfully?

PAROLLES  If I do not, damn me.

FIRST SOLDIER  Acordo linta. Come on, thou art
granted space.
[He exits with Parolles under guard.]

Go tell the Count Rossillion and my brother
We have caught the woodcock and will keep him
muffled
Till we do hear from them.

SECOND SOLDIER  Captain, I will.

He will betray us all unto ourselves.
Inform on that.

SECOND SOLDIER  So I will, sir.

Till then I'll keep him dark and safely locked.

[Enter Fool, Countess, and Lafew.]

LAFEW  No, no, no, your son was misled with a
snipped-taffeta fellow there, whose villainous saffron
would have made all the unbaked and doughy
youth of a nation in his color. Your daughter-in-law
had been alive at this hour, and your son here
at home, more advanced by the King than by that
red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.

COUNTESS  I would I had not known him. It was the
death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever
nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken
of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a
mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted

LAFEW  'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may
pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another
herb.

FOOL  Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
salad, or rather the herb of grace.

LAFEW  They are not herbs, you knave. They are
nose-herbs.

FOOL  I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir. I have not
much skill in grass.

LAFEW  Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a
fool?

FOOL  A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a
man's.

LAFEW  Your distinction?

FOOL  I would cozen the man of his wife and do his

LAFEW  So you were a knave at his service indeed.

FOOL  And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do
her service.

LAFEW  I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave
and fool.

FOOL  At your service.

LAFEW  No, no, no.

FOOL  Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
great a prince as you are.

LAFEW  Who's that, a Frenchman?

FOOL  Faith, sir, he has an English name, but his
phys'nomy is more hotter in France than there.

LAFEW  What prince is that?

FOOL  The black prince, sir, alias the prince of darkness,
alias the devil.

LAFEW, [giving him money]  Hold thee, there's my
purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy
master thou talk'st of. Serve him still.

FOOL  I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
great fire, and the master I speak of ever keeps a
good fire. But sure he is the prince of the world; let
his Nobility remain in 's court. I am for the house
with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little
for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves
may, but the many will be too chill and tender, and
they'll be for the flow'ry way that leads to the
broad gate and the great fire.

LAFEW  Go thy ways. I begin to be aweary of thee. And
I tell thee so before because I would not fall out
with thee. Go thy ways. Let my horses be well
looked to, without any tricks.

FOOL  If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
jades' tricks, which are their own right by the law
of nature.	[He exits.]

LAFEW  A shrewd knave and an unhappy.

COUNTESS  So he is. My lord that's gone made himself
much sport out of him. By his authority he
remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his
sauciness, and indeed he has no pace, but runs
where he will.

LAFEW  I like him well. 'Tis not amiss. And I was about
to tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death
and that my lord your son was upon his return
home, I moved the King my master to speak in the
behalf of my daughter, which in the minority of
them both his Majesty out of a self-gracious
remembrance did first propose. His Highness hath
promised me to do it, and to stop up the displeasure
he hath conceived against your son there is
no fitter matter. How does your Ladyship like it?

COUNTESS  With very much content, my lord, and I
wish it happily effected.

LAFEW  His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of
as able body as when he numbered thirty. He will
be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that in
such intelligence hath seldom failed.

COUNTESS  It rejoices me that, I hope, I shall see him
ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here
tonight. I shall beseech your Lordship to remain
with me till they meet together.

LAFEW  Madam, I was thinking with what manners I
might safely be admitted.

COUNTESS  You need but plead your honorable
privilege.

LAFEW  Lady, of that I have made a bold charter. But I
thank my God it holds yet.


FOOL  O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a
patch of velvet on 's face. Whether there be a scar
under 't or no, the velvet knows, but 'tis a goodly
patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile
and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.

LAFEW  A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry
of honor. So belike is that.

FOOL  But it is your carbonadoed face.

LAFEW  Let us go see your son, I pray you. I long to talk
with the young noble soldier.

FOOL  'Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
hats, and most courteous feathers which bow the
head and nod at every man.


CLEOPATRA  Charmian!

CHARMIAN  Madam?

CLEOPATRA  Ha, ha! Give me to drink mandragora.

CHARMIAN  Why, madam?

That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away.

CHARMIAN  You think of him too much.

O, 'tis treason!

CHARMIAN  Madam, I trust not so.

Thou, eunuch Mardian!

MARDIAN  What's your Highness' pleasure?

Not now to hear thee sing. I take no pleasure
In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee
That, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

MARDIAN  Yes, gracious madam.

CLEOPATRA  Indeed?

Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing
But what indeed is honest to be done.
Yet have I fierce affections, and think
What Venus did with Mars.

CLEOPATRA  O, Charmian,
Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
Or does he walk? Or is he on his horse?
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Do bravely, horse, for wot'st thou whom thou
mov'st?
The demi-Atlas of this Earth, the arm
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
Or murmuring "Where's my serpent of old Nile?"
For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
With most delicious poison. Think on me
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
When thou wast here above the ground, I was
A morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
There would he anchor his aspect, and die
With looking on his life.

[Enter Alexas from Antony.]

ALEXAS  Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Yet coming from him, that great med'cine hath
With his tinct gilded thee.
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?

ALEXAS  Last thing he did, dear queen,
He kissed--the last of many doubled kisses--
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.

Mine ear must pluck it thence.

ALEXAS  "Good friend," quoth
he,
"Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
To mend the petty present, I will piece
Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
Say thou, shall call her mistress." So he nodded
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke
Was beastly dumbed by him.

CLEOPATRA  What, was he sad, or merry?

Like to the time o' th' year between th' extremes
Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.

O, well-divided disposition!--Note him,
Note him, good Charmian, 'tis the man! But note
him:
He was not sad, for he would shine on those
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay
In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
O, heavenly mingle!--Be'st thou sad or merry,
The violence of either thee becomes,
So does it no man's else.--Met'st thou my posts?

Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
Why do you send so thick?

CLEOPATRA  Who's born that day
When I forget to send to Antony
Shall die a beggar.--Ink and paper, Charmian.--
Welcome, my good Alexas.--Did I, Charmian,
Ever love Caesar so?

CHARMIAN  O, that brave Caesar!

Be choked with such another emphasis!
Say "the brave Antony."

CHARMIAN  The valiant Caesar!

By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
If thou with Caesar paragon again
My man of men.

CHARMIAN  By your most gracious pardon,
I sing but after you.

CLEOPATRA  My salad days,
When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
To say as I said then. But come, away,
Get me ink and paper.
He shall have every day a several greeting,
Or I'll unpeople Egypt.

[Enter Ventidius as it were in triumph, the dead body of
Pacorus borne before him; with Silius and Soldiers.]

VENTIDIUS
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now
Pleased Fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

SILIUS  Noble Ventidius,
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
The fugitive Parthians follow. Spur through Media,
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
Put garlands on thy head.

VENTIDIUS  O, Silius, Silius,
I have done enough. A lower place, note well,
May make too great an act. For learn this, Silius:
Better to leave undone than by our deed
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve 's away.
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer than person. Sossius,
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
For quick accumulation of renown,
Which he achieved by th' minute, lost his favor.
Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
Than gain which darkens him.
I could do more to do Antonius good,
But 'twould offend him. And in his offense
Should my performance perish.

SILIUS  Thou hast, Ventidius, that
Without the which a soldier and his sword
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to
Antony?

VENTIDIUS
I'll humbly signify what in his name,
That magical word of war, we have effected;
How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
We have jaded out o' th' field.

SILIUS  Where is he now?

VENTIDIUS
He purposeth to Athens, whither, with what haste
The weight we must convey with 's will permit,
We shall appear before him.--On there, pass along!

[Enter Agrippa, Maecenas, and Caesar.]

Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
In Alexandria. Here's the manner of 't:
I' th' marketplace, on a tribunal silvered,
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
Were publicly enthroned. At the feet sat
Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
Since then hath made between them. Unto her
He gave the stablishment of Egypt, made her
Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
Absolute queen.

MAECENAS  This in the public eye?

I' th' common showplace where they exercise.
His sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings.
Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assigned
Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She
In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis
That day appeared, and oft before gave audience,
As 'tis reported, so.

MAECENAS  Let Rome be thus informed.

Who, queasy with his insolence already,
Will their good thoughts call from him.

The people knows it and have now received
His accusations.

AGRIPPA  Who does he accuse?

Caesar, and that, having in Sicily
Sextus Pompeius spoiled, we had not rated him
His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me
Some shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he frets
That Lepidus of the triumvirate
Should be deposed and, being, that we detain
All his revenue.

AGRIPPA  Sir, this should be answered.

'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,
That he his high authority abused
And did deserve his change. For what I have
conquered,
I grant him part; but then in his Armenia
And other of his conquered kingdoms I
Demand the like.

MAECENAS  He'll never yield to that.

Nor must not then be yielded to in this.

[Enter Octavia with her Train.]

OCTAVIA
Hail, Caesar, and my lord! Hail, most dear Caesar.

That ever I should call thee castaway!

OCTAVIA
You have not called me so, nor have you cause.

Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony
Should have an army for an usher and
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way
Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,
Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
Raised by your populous troops. But you are come
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
Is often left unloved. We should have met you
By sea and land, supplying every stage
With an augmented greeting.

OCTAVIA  Good my lord,
To come thus was I not constrained, but did it
On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
My grieved ear withal, whereon I begged
His pardon for return.

CAESAR  Which soon he granted,
Being an abstract 'tween his lust and him.

OCTAVIA
Do not say so, my lord.

CAESAR  I have eyes upon him,
And his affairs come to me on the wind.
Where is he now?

OCTAVIA  My lord, in Athens.

No, my most wronged sister. Cleopatra
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
Up to a whore, who now are levying
The kings o' th' Earth for war. He hath assembled
Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus
Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, King
Of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas,
The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
With a more larger list of scepters.

OCTAVIA  Ay me, most wretched,
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
That does afflict each other!

CAESAR  Welcome hither.
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth
Till we perceived both how you were wrong led
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart.
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
O'er your content these strong necessities,
But let determined things to destiny
Hold unbewailed their way. Welcome to Rome,
Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
To do you justice, makes his ministers
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
And ever welcome to us.

AGRIPPA  Welcome, lady.

MAECENAS  Welcome, dear madam.
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
Only th' adulterous Antony, most large
In his abominations, turns you off
And gives his potent regiment to a trull
That noises it against us.

OCTAVIA, [to Caesar]  Is it so, sir?

Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you
Be ever known to patience. My dear'st sister!

[Enter Caesar with his army, and Taurus, marching.]

CAESAR  Taurus!

TAURUS  My lord?

Strike not by land, keep whole. Provoke not battle
Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
The prescript of this scroll.	[Hands him a scroll.]
Our fortune lies
Upon this jump.

[Enter Caesar, Agrippa, and Maecenas, with his army,
Caesar reading a letter.]

He calls me "boy," and chides as he had power
To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger
He hath whipped with rods, dares me to personal
combat,
Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
I have many other ways to die; meantime
Laugh at his challenge.

MAECENAS  Caesar must think,
When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
Make boot of his distraction. Never anger
Made good guard for itself.

CAESAR  Let our best heads
Know that tomorrow the last of many battles
We mean to fight. Within our files there are,
Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
Enough to fetch him in. See it done,
And feast the army; we have store to do 't,
And they have earned the waste. Poor Antony.

[Enter Antony and Scarus, with their army.]

Their preparation is today by sea;
We please them not by land.

SCARUS  For both, my lord.

I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;
We'd fight there too. But this it is: our foot
Upon the hills adjoining to the city
Shall stay with us--order for sea is given;
They have put forth the haven--
Where their appointment we may best discover
And look on their endeavor.

[Enter Cleopatra and her maids aloft, with
Charmian and Iras.]

O Charmian, I will never go from hence.

Be comforted, dear madam.

CLEOPATRA  No, I will not.
All strange and terrible events are welcome,
But comforts we despise. Our size of sorrow,
Proportioned to our cause, must be as great
As that which makes it.

[Enter Diomedes below.]

How now? Is he dead?

His death's upon him, but not dead.
Look out o' th' other side your monument.
His guard have brought him thither.

[Enter Antony below, and the Guard bearing him.]

CLEOPATRA  O sun,
Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in. Darkling stand
The varying shore o' th' world! O Antony, Antony,
Antony! Help, Charmian! Help, Iras, help!
Help, friends below! Let's draw him hither.

ANTONY  Peace!
Not Caesar's valor hath o'erthrown Antony,
But Antony's hath triumphed on itself.

So it should be that none but Antony
Should conquer Antony, but woe 'tis so!

I am dying, Egypt, dying. Only
I here importune death awhile until
Of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay upon thy lips.

CLEOPATRA  I dare not, dear,
Dear my lord, pardon, I dare not,
Lest I be taken. Not th' imperious show
Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
Be brooched with me; if knife, drugs, serpents have
Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe.
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honor
Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony.--
Help me, my women!--We must draw thee up.--
Assist, good friends.	[They begin lifting him.]

ANTONY  O, quick, or I am gone.

Here's sport indeed. How heavy weighs my lord!
Our strength is all gone into heaviness;
That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power,
The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little.
Wishers were ever fools. O, come, come, come!
[They heave Antony aloft to Cleopatra.]
And welcome, welcome! Die when thou hast lived;
Quicken with kissing. Had my lips that power,
Thus would I wear them out.	[She kisses him.]

ALL  A heavy sight!

ANTONY  I am dying, Egypt, dying.
Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.

No, let me speak, and let me rail so high
That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel,
Provoked by my offense.

ANTONY  One word, sweet queen:
Of Caesar seek your honor with your safety--O!

They do not go together.

ANTONY  Gentle, hear me.
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.

My resolution and my hands I'll trust,
None about Caesar.

The miserable change now at my end
Lament nor sorrow at, but please your thoughts
In feeding them with those my former fortunes
Wherein I lived the greatest prince o' th' world,
The noblest, and do now not basely die,
Not cowardly put off my helmet to
My countryman--a Roman by a Roman
Valiantly vanquished. Now my spirit is going;
I can no more.

CLEOPATRA  Noblest of men, woo't die?
Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide
In this dull world, which in thy absence is
No better than a sty? O see, my women,
The crown o' th' Earth doth melt.--My lord!
[Antony dies.]
O, withered is the garland of the war;
The soldier's pole is fall'n; young boys and girls
Are level now with men. The odds is gone,
And there is nothing left remarkable
Beneath the visiting moon.

CHARMIAN  O, quietness, lady!
[Cleopatra swoons.]

IRAS  She's dead, too, our sovereign.

CHARMIAN  Lady!

IRAS  Madam!

CHARMIAN  O madam, madam, madam!

IRAS  Royal Egypt! Empress!	[Cleopatra stirs.]

CHARMIAN  Peace, peace, Iras!

No more but e'en a woman, and commanded
By such poor passion as the maid that milks
And does the meanest chares. It were for me
To throw my scepter at the injurious gods,
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
Till they had stolen our jewel. All's but naught.
Patience is sottish, and impatience does
Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
To rush into the secret house of death
Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
What, what, good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian?
My noble girls! Ah, women, women! Look,
Our lamp is spent; it's out. Good sirs, take heart.
We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's
noble,
Let's do 't after the high Roman fashion
And make death proud to take us. Come, away.
This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
Ah women, women! Come, we have no friend
But resolution and the briefest end.
[They exit, bearing off Antony's body.]



Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be. Some villains of my court
Are of consent and sufferance in this.

I cannot hear of any that did see her.
The ladies her attendants of her chamber
Saw her abed, and in the morning early
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.

My lord, the roinish clown at whom so oft
Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing.
Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,
Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
Your daughter and her cousin much commend
The parts and graces of the wrestler
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles,
And she believes wherever they are gone
That youth is surely in their company.

Send to his brother. Fetch that gallant hither.
If he be absent, bring his brother to me.
I'll make him find him. Do this suddenly,
And let not search and inquisition quail
To bring again these foolish runaways.

[Enter Orlando and Adam, meeting.]

ORLANDO  Who's there?

ADAM
What, my young master, O my gentle master,
O my sweet master, O you memory
Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
Why would you be so fond to overcome
The bonny prizer of the humorous duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
O, what a world is this when what is comely
Envenoms him that bears it!

ORLANDO  Why, what's the matter?

ADAM  O unhappy youth,
Come not within these doors. Within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives.
Your brother--no, no brother--yet the son--
Yet not the son, I will not call him son--
Of him I was about to call his father,
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
And you within it. If he fail of that,
He will have other means to cut you off.
I overheard him and his practices.
This is no place, this house is but a butchery.
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.

Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?

ADAM
No matter whither, so you come not here.

What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
A thievish living on the common road?
This I must do, or know not what to do;
Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
I rather will subject me to the malice
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.

ADAM
But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
Which I did store to be my foster nurse
When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
And unregarded age in corners thrown.
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
Be comfort to my age. Here is the gold.
All this I give you. Let me be your servant.
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility.
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
Frosty but kindly. Let me go with you.
I'll do the service of a younger man
In all your business and necessities.

O good old man, how well in thee appears
The constant service of the antique world,
When service sweat for duty, not for meed.
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
Where none will sweat but for promotion,
And having that do choke their service up
Even with the having. It is not so with thee.
But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree
That cannot so much as a blossom yield
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
But come thy ways. We'll go along together,
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
We'll light upon some settled low content.

ADAM
Master, go on, and I will follow thee
To the last gasp with truth and loyalty.
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
Here lived I, but now live here no more.
At seventeen years, many their fortunes seek,
But at fourscore, it is too late a week.
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
Than to die well, and not my master's debtor.

[Enter Amiens, Jaques, and others.]


	   Under the greenwood tree
	   Who loves to lie with me
	   And turn his merry note
	   Unto the sweet bird's throat,
	Come hither, come hither, come hither.
	      Here shall he see
	      No enemy
	But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES  More, more, I prithee, more.

AMIENS  It will make you melancholy, Monsieur
Jaques.

JAQUES  I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs.
More, I prithee, more.

AMIENS  My voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you.

JAQUES  I do not desire you to please me. I do desire
you to sing. Come, more, another stanzo. Call you
'em "stanzos"?

AMIENS  What you will, Monsieur Jaques.

JAQUES  Nay, I care not for their names. They owe me
nothing. Will you sing?

AMIENS  More at your request than to please myself.

JAQUES  Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank
you. But that they call "compliment" is like th'
encounter of two dog-apes. And when a man thanks
me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and
he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing. And
you that will not, hold your tongues.

AMIENS  Well, I'll end the song.--Sirs, cover the while;
the Duke will drink under this tree.--He hath been
all this day to look you.

JAQUES  And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
too disputable for my company. I think of as many
matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
boast of them. Come, warble, come.


ALL [together here.]
	   Who doth ambition shun
	   And loves to live i' th' sun,
	   Seeking the food he eats
	   And pleased with what he gets,
	Come hither, come hither, come hither.
	      Here shall he see
	      No enemy
	But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES  I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
yesterday in despite of my invention.

AMIENS  And I'll sing it.

JAQUES  Thus it goes:
	   If it do come to pass
	   That any man turn ass,
	   Leaving his wealth and ease
	   A stubborn will to please,
	Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame.
	      Here shall he see
	      Gross fools as he,
	An if he will come to me.

AMIENS  What's that "ducdame"?

JAQUES  'Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a
circle. I'll go sleep if I can. If I cannot, I'll rail
against all the first-born of Egypt.

AMIENS  And I'll go seek the Duke. His banquet is
prepared.


ADAM  Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for
food. Here lie I down and measure out my grave.
Farewell, kind master.	[He lies down.]

ORLANDO  Why, how now, Adam? No greater heart in
thee? Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a
little. If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I
will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee.
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. For my
sake, be comfortable. Hold death awhile at the
arm's end. I will here be with thee presently, and if
I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee
leave to die. But if thou diest before I come, thou art
a mocker of my labor. Well said. Thou look'st
cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly. Yet thou liest
in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some
shelter, and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if
there live anything in this desert. Cheerly, good
Adam.


[Enter Duke Frederick, Lords, and Oliver.]

DUKE FREDERICK, [to Oliver]
Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be.
But were I not the better part made mercy,
I should not seek an absent argument
Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is.
Seek him with candle. Bring him, dead or living,
Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
To seek a living in our territory.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine,
Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands
Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
Of what we think against thee.

O, that your Highness knew my heart in this:
I never loved my brother in my life.

More villain thou.--Well, push him out of doors,
And let my officers of such a nature
Make an extent upon his house and lands.
Do this expediently, and turn him going.

[Enter Rosalind, dressed as Ganymede, and Celia,

ROSALIND  Never talk to me. I will weep.

CELIA  Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider
that tears do not become a man.

ROSALIND  But have I not cause to weep?

CELIA  As good cause as one would desire. Therefore

ROSALIND  His very hair is of the dissembling color.

CELIA  Something browner than Judas's. Marry, his
kisses are Judas's own children.

ROSALIND  I' faith, his hair is of a good color.

CELIA  An excellent color. Your chestnut was ever the
only color.

ROSALIND  And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the
touch of holy bread.

CELIA  He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A
nun of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously.
The very ice of chastity is in them.

ROSALIND  But why did he swear he would come this
morning, and comes not?

CELIA  Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

ROSALIND  Do you think so?

CELIA  Yes, I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horse-stealer,
but for his verity in love, I do think him as
concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.

ROSALIND  Not true in love?

CELIA  Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.

ROSALIND  You have heard him swear downright he

CELIA  "Was" is not "is." Besides, the oath of a lover is
no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are
both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
here in the forest on the Duke your father.

ROSALIND  I met the Duke yesterday and had much
question with him. He asked me of what parentage
I was. I told him, of as good as he. So he laughed
and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when
there is such a man as Orlando?

CELIA  O, that's a brave man. He writes brave verses,
speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks
them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
his lover, as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on
one side breaks his staff like a noble goose; but all's
brave that youth mounts and folly guides.



Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
After the shepherd that complained of love,
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
That was his mistress.

CELIA, [as Aliena]  Well, and what of him?

If you will see a pageant truly played
Between the pale complexion of true love
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you
If you will mark it.

ROSALIND, [aside to Celia]  O come, let us remove.
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
[As Ganymede, to Corin.] 
Bring us to this sight, andyou shall say
I'll prove a busy actor in their play.



TOUCHSTONE  Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey. Tomorrow
will we be married.

AUDREY  I do desire it with all my heart, and I hope it is
no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the

[Enter two Pages.]

Here come two of the banished duke's pages.

FIRST PAGE  Well met, honest gentleman.

TOUCHSTONE  By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and
a song.

SECOND PAGE  We are for you. Sit i' th' middle.

FIRST PAGE  Shall we clap into 't roundly, without
hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which
are the only prologues to a bad voice?

SECOND PAGE  I' faith, i' faith, and both in a tune like
two gypsies on a horse.


PAGES [sing]
	It was a lover and his lass,
	   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,
	That o'er the green cornfield did pass
	   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
	Sweet lovers love the spring.

	Between the acres of the rye,
	   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,
	These pretty country folks would lie
	   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
	Sweet lovers love the spring.

	This carol they began that hour,
	   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,
	How that a life was but a flower
	   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
	Sweet lovers love the spring.

	And therefore take the present time,
	   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,
	For love is crowned with the prime,
	   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
	Sweet lovers love the spring.

TOUCHSTONE  Truly, young gentlemen, though there
was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was
very untunable.

FIRST PAGE  You are deceived, sir. We kept time. We lost
not our time.

TOUCHSTONE  By my troth, yes. I count it but time lost
to hear such a foolish song. God be wi' you, and
God mend your voices.--Come, Audrey.
[They rise and exit.]

[Enter Cominius as it were in retire, with Soldiers.]

Breathe you, my friends. Well fought! We are come
off
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands
Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs,
We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends. The Roman gods
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That both our powers, with smiling fronts
encount'ring,
May give you thankful sacrifice!


Thy news?

The citizens of Corioles have issued
And given to Lartius and to Martius battle.
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
And then I came away.

COMINIUS  Though thou speakest truth,
Methinks thou speak'st not well. How long is 't

MESSENGER  Above an hour, my lord.

'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
And bring thy news so late?

MESSENGER  Spies of the Volsces
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
Three or four miles about; else had I, sir,
Half an hour since brought my report.	[He exits.]

[Enter Martius, bloody.]

COMINIUS  Who's yonder,
That does appear as he were flayed? O gods,
He has the stamp of Martius, and I have
Before-time seen him thus.

MARTIUS  Come I too late?

The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
More than I know the sound of Martius' tongue
From every meaner man.

MARTIUS  Come I too late?

Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own.

MARTIUS  O, let me clip you
In arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done
And tapers burnt to bedward!	[They embrace.]

Flower of warriors, how is 't with Titus Lartius?

As with a man busied about decrees,
Condemning some to death and some to exile;
Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other;
Holding Corioles in the name of Rome
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let him slip at will.

COMINIUS  Where is that slave
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is he? Call him hither.

MARTIUS  Let him alone.
He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen,
The common file--a plague! Tribunes for them!--
The mouse ne'er shunned the cat as they did budge
From rascals worse than they.

COMINIUS  But how prevailed you?

Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
Where is the enemy? Are you lords o' th' field?
If not, why cease you till you are so?

Martius, we have at disadvantage fought
And did retire to win our purpose.

How lies their battle? Know you on which side
They have placed their men of trust?

COMINIUS  As I guess,
Martius,
Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.

MARTIUS  I do beseech you,
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
By th' blood we have shed together, by th' vows we
have made
To endure friends, that you directly set me
Against Aufidius and his Antiates,
And that you not delay the present, but,
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
We prove this very hour.

COMINIUS  Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking. Take your choice of those
That best can aid your action.

MARTIUS  Those are they
That most are willing. If any such be here--
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
Wherein you see me smeared; if any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad life,
And that his country's dearer than himself;
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus to express his disposition
And follow Martius.	[He waves his sword.]
[They all shout and wave their swords,
take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps.]
O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is four Volsces? None of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
Though thanks to all, must I select from all.
The rest shall bear the business in some other fight,
As cause will be obeyed. Please you to march,
And I shall quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclined.

COMINIUS  March on, my fellows.
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
Divide in all with us.

[Enter Menenius with the two Tribunes of the people,
Sicinius and Brutus.]

MENENIUS  The augurer tells me we shall have news

BRUTUS  Good or bad?

MENENIUS  Not according to the prayer of the people,
for they love not Martius.

SICINIUS  Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

MENENIUS  Pray you, who does the wolf love?

SICINIUS  The lamb.

MENENIUS  Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians
would the noble Martius.

BRUTUS  He's a lamb indeed, that baas like a bear.

MENENIUS  He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb.
You two are old men; tell me one thing that I shall
ask you.

BOTH  Well, sir.

MENENIUS  In what enormity is Martius poor in, that
you two have not in abundance?

BRUTUS  He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.

SICINIUS  Especially in pride.

BRUTUS  And topping all others in boasting.

MENENIUS  This is strange now. Do you two know how
you are censured here in the city, I mean of us o'
th' right-hand file, do you?

BOTH  Why, how are we censured?

MENENIUS  Because you talk of pride now, will you not
be angry?

BOTH  Well, well, sir, well?

MENENIUS  Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little
thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience.
Give your dispositions the reins, and be
angry at your pleasures, at the least, if you take it
as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame Martius
for being proud.

BRUTUS  We do it not alone, sir.

MENENIUS  I know you can do very little alone, for
your helps are many, or else your actions would
grow wondrous single. Your abilities are too infantlike
for doing much alone. You talk of pride. O,
that you could turn your eyes toward the napes
of your necks and make but an interior survey of
your good selves! O, that you could!

BOTH  What then, sir?

MENENIUS  Why, then you should discover a brace of
unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias
fools, as any in Rome.

SICINIUS  Menenius, you are known well enough, too.

MENENIUS  I am known to be a humorous patrician and
one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of
allaying Tiber in 't; said to be something imperfect
in favoring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like
upon too trivial motion; one that converses
more with the buttock of the night than with the
forehead of the morning. What I think I utter,
and spend my malice in my breath. Meeting two
such wealsmen as you are--I cannot call you
Lycurguses--if the drink you give me touch my
palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it. I cannot
say your Worships have delivered the matter
well when I find the ass in compound with the
major part of your syllables. And though I must
be content to bear with those that say you are reverend
grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell you
have good faces. If you see this in the map of my
microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough
too? What harm can your bisson conspectuities
glean out of this character, if I be known well
enough, too?

BRUTUS  Come, sir, come; we know you well enough.

MENENIUS  You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps
and legs. You wear out a good wholesome forenoon
in hearing a cause between an orange-wife
and a faucet-seller, and then rejourn the controversy
of threepence to a second day of audience.
When you are hearing a matter between party and
party, if you chance to be pinched with the colic,
you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody
flag against all patience, and, in roaring for a
chamber pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding,
the more entangled by your hearing. All the peace
you make in their cause is calling both the parties
knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS  Come, come. You are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol.

MENENIUS  Our very priests must become mockers if
they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as
you are. When you speak best unto the purpose, it
is not worth the wagging of your beards, and your
beards deserve not so honorable a grave as to
stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entombed in an
ass's packsaddle. Yet you must be saying Martius is
proud, who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all
your predecessors since Deucalion, though peradventure
some of the best of 'em were hereditary
hangmen. Good e'en to your Worships. More of
your conversation would infect my brain, being
the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. I will be
bold to take my leave of you.
[He begins to exit. Brutus and Sicinius stand aside.]

[Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Valeria.]

How now, my as fair as noble ladies--and the
moon, were she earthly, no nobler--whither do
you follow your eyes so fast?

VOLUMNIA  Honorable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go!

MENENIUS  Ha? Martius coming home?

VOLUMNIA  Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous
approbation.

MENENIUS  Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee! [(He
throws his cap in the air.)] Hoo! Martius coming

VALERIA, VIRGILIA  Nay, 'tis true.

VOLUMNIA  Look, here's a letter from him. [She produces
a paper.] The state hath another, his wife another,
and I think there's one at home for you.

MENENIUS  I will make my very house reel tonight. A
letter for me?

VIRGILIA  Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw 't.

MENENIUS  A letter for me? It gives me an estate of
seven years' health, in which time I will make a lip
at the physician. The most sovereign prescription
in Galen is but empiricutic and, to this preservative,
of no better report than a horse drench. Is he not
wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.

VIRGILIA  O no, no, no!

VOLUMNIA  O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for 't.

MENENIUS  So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings he
victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.

VOLUMNIA  On 's brows, Menenius. He comes the third
time home with the oaken garland.

MENENIUS  Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA  Titus Lartius writes they fought together,
but Aufidius got off.

MENENIUS  And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him
that. An he had stayed by him, I would not have
been so 'fidiused for all the chests in Corioles and
the gold that's in them. Is the Senate possessed of

VOLUMNIA  Good ladies, let's go.--Yes, yes, yes. The
Senate has letters from the General, wherein he
gives my son the whole name of the war. He hath
in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.

VALERIA  In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of

MENENIUS  Wondrous? Ay, I warrant you, and not without
his true purchasing.

VIRGILIA  The gods grant them true.

VOLUMNIA  True? Pow waw!

MENENIUS  True? I'll be sworn they are true. Where is
he wounded? [(To the Tribunes.)] God save your
good Worships! Martius is coming home; he has
more cause to be proud.--Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA  I' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm. There will
be large cicatrices to show the people when he
shall stand for his place. He received in the repulse
of Tarquin seven hurts i' th' body.

MENENIUS  One i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh--there's
nine that I know.

VOLUMNIA  He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
wounds upon him.

MENENIUS  Now it's twenty-seven. Every gash was an
enemy's grave. [(A shout and flourish.)] Hark, the
trumpets!

VOLUMNIA  These are the ushers of Martius: before him
he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie,
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
[A sennet.]

[Enter Cominius the General and Titus Lartius, between
them Coriolanus crowned with an oaken garland, with
Captains and Soldiers and a Herald. Trumpets sound.]

Know, Rome, that all alone Martius did fight
Within Corioles' gates, where he hath won,
With fame, a name to Martius Caius; these
In honor follows "Coriolanus."
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus.
[Sound flourish.]

Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

No more of this. It does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.

COMINIUS  Look, sir, your mother.

CORIOLANUS  O,
You have, I know, petitioned all the gods
For my prosperity.	[Kneels.]

VOLUMNIA  Nay, my good soldier, up.
[He stands.]
My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and
By deed-achieving honor newly named--
What is it? Coriolanus must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife--

CORIOLANUS  My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear
And mothers that lack sons.

MENENIUS  Now the gods crown

And live you yet? [(To Valeria.)] O, my sweet lady,

I know not where to turn. O, welcome home!--
And, welcome, general.--And you're welcome all.

A hundred thousand welcomes! I could weep,
And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome.
A curse begin at very root on 's heart
That is not glad to see thee! You are three
That Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men,
We have some old crab trees here at home that will
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors!
We call a nettle but a nettle, and
The faults of fools but folly.

COMINIUS  Ever right.

CORIOLANUS  Menenius ever, ever.

Give way there, and go on!

CORIOLANUS, [to Volumnia and Virgilia]  Your hand
and yours.
Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
The good patricians must be visited,
From whom I have received not only greetings,
But with them change of honors.

VOLUMNIA  I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy. Only
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee.

CORIOLANUS  Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way
Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS  On, to the Capitol.
[Flourish of cornets. They exit in state, as before.]

[Brutus and Sicinius come forward.]

All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him. The kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clamb'ring the walls to eye him. Stalls, bulks,
windows
Are smothered up, leads filled, and ridges horsed
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station. Our veiled dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely-gauded cheeks to th' wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses. Such a pother,
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slyly crept into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture.

SICINIUS  On the sudden
I warrant him consul.

BRUTUS  Then our office may,
During his power, go sleep.

He cannot temp'rately transport his honors
From where he should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won.

BRUTUS  In that there's comfort.

SICINIUS  Doubt
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honors--which
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to do 't.

BRUTUS  I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i' th' marketplace nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility,
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To th' people, beg their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS  'Tis right.

It was his word. O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS  I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution.

BRUTUS  'Tis most like he will.

It shall be to him then as our good wills,
A sure destruction.

BRUTUS  So it must fall out
To him, or our authority's for an end.
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to 's power he would
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders, and
Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them
In human action and capacity
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in their war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.

SICINIUS  This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want
If he be put upon 't, and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze
Shall darken him forever.



You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
That Martius shall be consul. I have seen
The dumb men throng to see him, and the blind
To hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs,
Upon him as he passed; the nobles bended
As to Jove's statue, and the Commons made
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.

BRUTUS  Let's to the Capitol,
And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time,
But hearts for the event.

SICINIUS  Have with you.

[Enter Cloten and the two Lords.]

CLOTEN  Was there ever man had such luck? When I
kissed the jack, upon an upcast to be hit away? I
had a hundred pound on 't. And then a whoreson
jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I
borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend
them at my pleasure.

FIRST LORD  What got he by that? You have broke his
pate with your bowl.

SECOND LORD, [aside]  If his wit had been like him that
broke it, it would have run all out.

CLOTEN  When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is
not for any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?

SECOND LORD  No, my lord, [(aside)] nor crop the ears
of them.

CLOTEN  Whoreson dog! I gave him satisfaction. Would
he had been one of my rank.

SECOND LORD, [aside]  To have smelled like a fool.

CLOTEN  I am not vexed more at anything in th' Earth.
A pox on 't! I had rather not be so noble as I am.
They dare not fight with me because of the Queen
my mother. Every jack-slave hath his bellyful of
fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock
that nobody can match.

SECOND LORD, [aside]  You are cock and capon too, and
you crow cock with your comb on.

CLOTEN  Sayest thou?

SECOND LORD  It is not fit your Lordship should undertake
every companion that you give offense to.

CLOTEN  No, I know that, but it is fit I should commit
offense to my inferiors.

SECOND LORD  Ay, it is fit for your Lordship only.

CLOTEN  Why, so I say.

FIRST LORD  Did you hear of a stranger that's come to
court tonight?

CLOTEN  A stranger, and I not know on 't?

SECOND LORD, [aside]  He's a strange fellow himself and
knows it not.

FIRST LORD  There's an Italian come, and 'tis thought
one of Leonatus' friends.

CLOTEN  Leonatus? A banished rascal; and he's another,
whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?

FIRST LORD  One of your Lordship's pages.

CLOTEN  Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no
derogation in 't?

SECOND LORD  You cannot derogate, my lord.

CLOTEN  Not easily, I think.

SECOND LORD, [aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore
your issues, being foolish, do not derogate.

CLOTEN  Come, I'll go see this Italian. What I have lost
today at bowls I'll win tonight of him. Come, go.

SECOND LORD  I'll attend your Lordship.
[Cloten and First Lord exit.]
That such a crafty devil as is his mother
Should yield the world this ass! A woman that
Bears all down with her brain, and this her son
Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st,
Betwixt a father by thy stepdame governed,
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
More hateful than the foul expulsion is
Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm
The walls of thy dear honor, keep unshaked
That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand
T' enjoy thy banished lord and this great land.

[Enter Pisanio reading of a letter.]

How? Of adultery? Wherefore write you not
What monsters her accuse? Leonatus,
O master, what a strange infection
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,
As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevailed
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.
She's punished for her truth and undergoes,
More goddesslike than wifelike, such assaults
As would take in some virtue. O my master,
Thy mind to her is now as low as were
Thy fortunes. How? That I should murder her,
Upon the love and truth and vows which I
Have made to thy command? I her? Her blood?
If it be so to do good service, never
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I
That I should seem to lack humanity
So much as this fact comes to? [(He reads:)] Do 't!
The letter
That I have sent her, by her own command
Shall give thee opportunity. O damned paper,
Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,
Art thou a fedary for this act, and look'st
So virginlike without? Lo, here she comes.


I am ignorant in what I am commanded.

IMOGEN  How now, Pisanio?

Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

Who, thy lord that is my lord, Leonatus?
O, learned indeed were that astronomer
That knew the stars as I his characters!
He'd lay the future open. You good gods,
Let what is here contained relish of love,
Of my lord's health, of his content (yet not
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him.
Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
For it doth physic love) of his content
All but in that. Good wax, thy leave.
[She opens the letter.]
Blest be
You bees that make these locks of counsel. Lovers
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
[Reads.] Justice and your father's wrath, should he
take me in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me
as you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew
me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria
at Milford Haven. What your own love will out of
this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness,
that remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing
in love.
Leonatus Posthumus.
O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
May plod it in a week, why may not I
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,
Who long'st like me to see thy lord, who long'st--
O, let me bate--but not like me, yet long'st
But in a fainter kind--O, not like me,
For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick--
Love's counselor should fill the bores of hearing
To th' smothering of the sense--how far it is
To this same blessed Milford. And by th' way
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
T' inherit such a haven. But first of all,
How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
That we shall make in time from our hence-going
And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence?
Why should excuse be born or ere begot?
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,
How many score of miles may we well rid
'Twixt hour and hour?

PISANIO  One score 'twixt sun and sun,
Madam, 's enough for you, and too much too.

Why, one that rode to 's execution, man,
Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
That run i' th' clock's behalf. But this is fool'ry.
Go, bid my woman feign a sickness, say
She'll home to her father; and provide me presently
A riding suit no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.

PISANIO  Madam, you're best consider.

I see before me, man. Nor here, nor here,
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee.
Do as I bid thee. There's no more to say.
Accessible is none but Milford way.

[Enter, as from a cave, Belarius as Morgan, Guiderius
as Polydor, and Arviragus as Cadwal.]

A goodly day not to keep house with such
Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys. This gate
Instructs you how t' adore the heavens and bows you
To a morning's holy office. The gates of monarchs
Are arched so high that giants may jet through
And keep their impious turbans on, without
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
We house i' th' rock, yet use thee not so hardly
As prouder livers do.

GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Hail, heaven!

ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  Hail, heaven!

Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill;
Your legs are young. I'll tread these flats. Consider,
When you above perceive me like a crow,
That it is place which lessens and sets off,
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.
This service is not service, so being done,
But being so allowed. To apprehend thus
Draws us a profit from all things we see,
And often, to our comfort, shall we find
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Than is the full-winged eagle. O, this life
Is nobler than attending for a check,
Richer than doing nothing for a robe,
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine
Yet keeps his book uncrossed. No life to ours.

Out of your proof you speak. We poor unfledged
Have never winged from view o' th' nest, nor know
What air 's from home. Haply this life is best
If quiet life be best, sweeter to you
That have a sharper known, well corresponding
With your stiff age; but unto us it is
A cell of ignorance, traveling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
To stride a limit.

ARVIRAGUS, [as Cadwal]  What should we speak of
When we are old as you? When we shall hear
The rain and wind beat dark December, how
In this our pinching cave shall we discourse
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing.
We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat.
Our valor is to chase what flies. Our cage
We make a choir, as doth the prisoned bird,
And sing our bondage freely.

BELARIUS, [as Morgan]  How you speak!
Did you but know the city's usuries
And felt them knowingly; the art o' th' court,
As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb
Is certain falling, or so slipp'ry that
The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' th' war,
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
I' th' name of fame and honor, which dies i' th' search
And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph
As record of fair act--nay, many times
Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
Must curtsy at the censure. O boys, this story
The world may read in me. My body's marked
With Roman swords, and my report was once
First with the best of note. Cymbeline loved me,
And when a soldier was the theme, my name
Was not far off. Then was I as a tree
Whose boughs did bend with fruit. But in one night
A storm or robbery, call it what you will,
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
And left me bare to weather.

GUIDERIUS, [as Polydor]  Uncertain favor!

My fault being nothing, as I have told you oft,
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevailed
Before my perfect honor, swore to Cymbeline
I was confederate with the Romans. So
Followed my banishment; and this twenty years
This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
More pious debts to heaven than in all
The fore-end of my time. But up to th' mountains!
This is not hunters' language. He that strikes
The venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast;
To him the other two shall minister,
And we will fear no poison, which attends
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
[Guiderius and Arviragus exit.]

How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
These boys know little they are sons to th' King,
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
They think they are mine, and, though trained up
thus meanly,
I' th' cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
In simple and low things to prince it much
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydor,
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
The King his father called Guiderius--Jove!
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
Into my story; say "Thus mine enemy fell,
And thus I set my foot on 's neck," even then
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
His own conceiving. Hark, the game is roused!
O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows
Thou didst unjustly banish me; whereon,
At three and two years old I stole these babes,
Thinking to bar thee of succession as
Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their
mother,
And every day do honor to her grave.
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan called,
They take for natural father. The game is up!

[Enter Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten, Lucius, Lords, and

Thus far, and so farewell.

LUCIUS  Thanks, royal sir.
My emperor hath wrote I must from hence,
And am right sorry that I must report you
My master's enemy.

CYMBELINE  Our subjects, sir,
Will not endure his yoke, and for ourself
To show less sovereignty than they must needs
Appear unkinglike.

LUCIUS  So, sir. I desire of you
A conduct overland to Milford Haven.--
Madam, all joy befall your Grace--and you.

CYMBELINE, [to Lords]
My lords, you are appointed for that office.
The due of honor in no point omit.--
So, farewell, noble Lucius.

LUCIUS, [to Cloten]  Your hand, my lord.

Receive it friendly, but from this time forth
I wear it as your enemy.

LUCIUS  Sir, the event
Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.

Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
Till he have crossed the Severn. Happiness!
[Exit Lucius and Lords.]

He goes hence frowning, but it honors us
That we have given him cause.

CLOTEN  'Tis all the better.
Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.

Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor
How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness.
The powers that he already hath in Gallia
Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
His war for Britain.

QUEEN  'Tis not sleepy business,
But must be looked to speedily and strongly.

Our expectation that it would be thus
Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
Where is our daughter? She hath not appeared
Before the Roman, nor to us hath tendered
The duty of the day. She looks us like
A thing more made of malice than of duty.
We have noted it.--Call her before us, for
We have been too slight in sufferance.

QUEEN  Royal sir,
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired
Hath her life been, the cure whereof, my lord,
'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
Forbear sharp speeches to her. She's a lady
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
And strokes death to her.

[Enter Attendant.]

CYMBELINE  Where is she, sir? How
Can her contempt be answered?

ATTENDANT  Please you, sir,
Her chambers are all locked, and there's no answer
That will be given to th' loud'st noise we make.

My lord, when last I went to visit her,
She prayed me to excuse her keeping close;
Whereto constrained by her infirmity,
She should that duty leave unpaid to you
Which daily she was bound to proffer. This
She wished me to make known, but our great court
Made me to blame in memory.

CYMBELINE  Her doors locked?
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I
Fear prove false!	[He exits with Attendant.]

QUEEN  Son, I say, follow the King.

That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant
I have not seen these two days.

QUEEN  Go, look after.
[Cloten exits.]
[Aside.] Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus--
He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
It is a thing most precious. But for her,
Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seized her,
Or, winged with fervor of her love, she's flown
To her desired Posthumus. Gone she is
To death or to dishonor, and my end
Can make good use of either. She being down,
I have the placing of the British crown.


How now, my son?

CLOTEN  'Tis certain she is fled.
Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none
Dare come about him.

QUEEN, [aside]  All the better. May
This night forestall him of the coming day!
[Queen exits, with Attendants.]

I love and hate her, for she's fair and royal,
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one
The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
Outsells them all. I love her therefore, but
Disdaining me and throwing favors on
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
That what's else rare is choked. And in that point
I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
To be revenged upon her. For, when fools
Shall--


Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
Come hither. Ah, you precious pander! Villain,
Where is thy lady? In a word, or else
Thou art straightway with the fiends.

PISANIO  O, good my lord--

Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter--
I will not ask again. Close villain,
I'll have this secret from thy heart or rip
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus,
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
A dram of worth be drawn?

PISANIO  Alas, my lord,
How can she be with him? When was she missed?
He is in Rome.

CLOTEN  Where is she, sir? Come nearer.
No farther halting. Satisfy me home
What is become of her.

O, my all-worthy lord!

CLOTEN  All-worthy villain!
Discover where thy mistress is at once,
At the next word. No more of "worthy lord"!
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
Thy condemnation and thy death.

PISANIO  Then, sir,
This paper is the history of my knowledge
Touching her flight.	[He gives Cloten a paper.]

CLOTEN  Let's see 't. I will pursue her
Even to Augustus' throne.

PISANIO, [aside]  Or this or perish.
She's far enough, and what he learns by this
May prove his travail, not her danger.

CLOTEN  Humh!

I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!

CLOTEN  Sirrah, is this letter true?

PISANIO  Sir, as I think.

CLOTEN  It is Posthumus' hand, I know 't. Sirrah, if
thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,
undergo those employments wherein I should
have cause to use thee with a serious industry--
that is, what villainy soe'er I bid thee do to perform
it directly and truly--I would think thee an honest
man. Thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
relief nor my voice for thy preferment.

PISANIO  Well, my good lord.

CLOTEN  Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and
constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not in the
course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of
mine. Wilt thou serve me?

PISANIO  Sir, I will.

CLOTEN  Give me thy hand. Here's my purse. [Gives
him money.] Hast any of thy late master's garments
in thy possession?

PISANIO  I have, my lord, at my lodging the same suit he
wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.

CLOTEN  The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit
hither. Let it be thy first service. Go.

PISANIO  I shall, my lord.	[He exits.]

CLOTEN  Meet thee at Milford Haven!--I forgot to ask
him one thing; I'll remember 't anon. Even there,
thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would
these garments were come. She said upon a time--
the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--
that she held the very garment of Posthumus in
more respect than my noble and natural person,
together with the adornment of my qualities. With
that suit upon my back will I ravish her. First, kill
him, and in her eyes. There shall she see my valor,
which will then be a torment to her contempt.
He on the ground, my speech of insultment
ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath
dined--which, as I say, to vex her I will execute
in the clothes that she so praised--to the court
I'll knock her back, foot her home again. She hath
despised me rejoicingly, and I'll be merry in my

[Enter Pisanio with the clothes.]

Be those the garments?

PISANIO  Ay, my noble lord.

CLOTEN  How long is 't since she went to Milford Haven?

PISANIO  She can scarce be there yet.

CLOTEN  Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the
second thing that I have commanded thee. The
third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my
design. Be but duteous, and true preferment shall
tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford.
Would I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true.

Thou bidd'st me to my loss, for true to thee
Were to prove false, which I will never be,
To him that is most true. To Milford go,
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
You heavenly blessings, on her. This fool's speed
Be crossed with slowness. Labor be his meed.

[Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]

So much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.
You do remember all the circumstance?

HORATIO  Remember it, my lord!

Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly--
And praised be rashness for it; let us know,
Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will--

HORATIO  That is most

HAMLET  Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark
Groped I to find out them; had my desire,
Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again, making so bold
(My fears forgetting manners) to unfold
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,
A royal knavery--an exact command,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
With--ho!--such bugs and goblins in my life,
That on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the ax,
My head should be struck off.

HORATIO  Is 't possible?

Here's the commission. Read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed?

HORATIO  I beseech you.

Being thus benetted round with villainies,
Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
They had begun the play. I sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair--
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair, and labored much
How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
Th' effect of what I wrote?

HORATIO  Ay, good my lord.

An earnest conjuration from the King,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And many suchlike ases of great charge,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
Without debatement further, more or less,
He should those bearers put to sudden death,
Not shriving time allowed.

HORATIO  How was this sealed?

Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
Subscribed it, gave 't th' impression, placed it
safely,
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Thou knowest already.

So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to 't.

Why, man, they did make love to this employment.
They are not near my conscience. Their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow.
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.

HORATIO  Why, what a king is this!

Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon--
He that hath killed my king and whored my mother,
Popped in between th' election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such cozenage--is 't not perfect
To quit him with this arm? And is 't not to be
damned
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil?

It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there.

It will be short. The interim's mine,
And a man's life's no more than to say "one."
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself,
For by the image of my cause I see
The portraiture of his. I'll court his favors.
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a tow'ring passion.

HORATIO  Peace, who comes here?

[Enter Osric, a courtier.]

OSRIC  Your Lordship is right welcome back to
Denmark.

HAMLET  I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio.]
Dost know this waterfly?

HORATIO, [aside to Hamlet]  No, my good lord.

HAMLET, [aside to Horatio]  Thy state is the more gracious,
for 'tis a vice to know him. He hath much
land, and fertile. Let a beast be lord of beasts and his
crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis a chough,
but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

OSRIC  Sweet lord, if your Lordship were at leisure, I
should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.

HAMLET  I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use: 'tis for the

OSRIC  I thank your Lordship; it is very hot.

HAMLET  No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
northerly.

OSRIC  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

HAMLET  But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for
my complexion.

OSRIC  Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as
'twere--I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majesty
bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager
on your head. Sir, this is the matter--

HAMLET  I beseech you, remember. [He motions to
Osric to put on his hat.]

OSRIC  Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith.
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes--believe
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
differences, of very soft society and great showing.
Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see.

HAMLET  Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in
you, though I know to divide him inventorially
would dozy th' arithmetic of memory, and yet but
yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness
as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his
mirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage,
nothing more.

OSRIC  Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

HAMLET  The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the
gentleman in our more rawer breath?

OSRIC  Sir?

HORATIO  Is 't not possible to understand in another
tongue? You will to 't, sir, really.

HAMLET, [to Osric]  What imports the nomination of
this gentleman?

OSRIC  Of Laertes?

HORATIO  His purse is empty already; all 's golden words
are spent.

HAMLET  Of him, sir.

OSRIC  I know you are not ignorant--

HAMLET  I would you did, sir. Yet, in faith, if you did, it
would not much approve me. Well, sir?

OSRIC  You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes
is--

HAMLET  I dare not confess that, lest I should compare
with him in excellence. But to know a man well
were to know himself.

OSRIC  I mean, sir, for his weapon. But in the imputation
laid on him by them, in his meed he's
unfellowed.

HAMLET  What's his weapon?

OSRIC  Rapier and dagger.

HAMLET  That's two of his weapons. But, well--

OSRIC  The King, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
horses, against the which he has impawned, as I
take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and
of very liberal conceit.

HAMLET  What call you the "carriages"?

HORATIO  I knew you must be edified by the margent
ere you had done.

OSRIC  The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

HAMLET  The phrase would be more germane to the
matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides. I
would it might be "hangers" till then. But on. Six
Barbary horses against six French swords, their
assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages--
that's the French bet against the Danish. Why is this
all "impawned," as you call it?

OSRIC  The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen
passes between yourself and him, he shall not
exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for
nine, and it would come to immediate trial if your
Lordship would vouchsafe the answer.

HAMLET  How if I answer no?

OSRIC  I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person
in trial.

HAMLET  Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
King hold his purpose, I will win for him, an I can.
If not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd
hits.

OSRIC  Shall I deliver you e'en so?

HAMLET  To this effect, sir, after what flourish your
nature will.

OSRIC  I commend my duty to your Lordship.

HAMLET  Yours. [Osric exits.] He does well to commend
it himself. There are no tongues else for 's

HORATIO  This lapwing runs away with the shell on his

HAMLET  He did comply, sir, with his dug before he
sucked it. Thus has he (and many more of the same
breed that I know the drossy age dotes on) only got
the tune of the time, and, out of an habit of
encounter, a kind of yeasty collection, which carries
them through and through the most fanned
and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to
their trial, the bubbles are out.


LORD  My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by
young Osric, who brings back to him that you
attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your
pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
take longer time.

HAMLET  I am constant to my purposes. They follow
the King's pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is
ready now or whensoever, provided I be so able as

LORD  The King and Queen and all are coming down.

HAMLET  In happy time.

LORD  The Queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.

HAMLET  She well instructs me.	[Lord exits.]

HORATIO  You will lose, my lord.

HAMLET  I do not think so. Since he went into France, I
have been in continual practice. I shall win at the
odds; but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
about my heart. But it is no matter.

HORATIO  Nay, good my lord--

HAMLET  It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of
gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman.

HORATIO  If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will
forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.

HAMLET  Not a whit. We defy augury. There is a
special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be
now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The
readiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves
knows, what is 't to leave betimes? Let be.

[A table prepared. Enter Trumpets, Drums, and Officers
with cushions, King, Queen, Osric, and all the state,
foils, daggers, flagons of wine, and Laertes.]

Come, Hamlet, come and take this hand from me.
[He puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]

HAMLET, [to Laertes]
Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
But pardon 't as you are a gentleman. This presence
knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punished
With a sore distraction. What I have done
That might your nature, honor, and exception
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was 't Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? His madness. If 't be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Sir, in this audience
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
And hurt my brother.

LAERTES  I am satisfied in nature,
Whose motive in this case should stir me most
To my revenge; but in my terms of honor
I stand aloof and will no reconcilement
Till by some elder masters of known honor
I have a voice and precedent of peace
To keep my name ungored. But till that time
I do receive your offered love like love
And will not wrong it.

HAMLET  I embrace it freely
And will this brothers' wager frankly play.--
Give us the foils. Come on.

LAERTES  Come, one for me.

I'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
Stick fiery off indeed.

LAERTES  You mock me, sir.

HAMLET  No, by this hand.

Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
You know the wager?

HAMLET  Very well, my lord.
Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.

I do not fear it; I have seen you both.
But, since he is better, we have therefore odds.

This is too heavy. Let me see another.

This likes me well. These foils have all a length?

OSRIC  Ay, my good lord.
[Prepare to play.]

Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.--
If Hamlet give the first or second hit
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire.
The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
"Now the King drinks to Hamlet." Come, begin.
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
[Trumpets the while.]

HAMLET  Come on, sir.

LAERTES  Come, my lord.	[They play.]

HAMLET  One.

LAERTES  No.

HAMLET  Judgment!

OSRIC  A hit, a very palpable hit.

LAERTES  Well, again.

Stay, give me drink.--Hamlet, this pearl is thine.
Here's to thy health.
[He drinks and then drops the pearl in the cup.]
[Drum, trumpets, and shot.]
Give him the cup.

I'll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.
Come. [They play.] Another hit. What say you?

A touch, a touch. I do confess 't.

Our son shall win.

QUEEN  He's fat and scant of breath.--
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin; rub thy brows.
The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
[She lifts the cup.]

HAMLET  Good madam.

KING  Gertrude, do not drink.

I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.	[She drinks.]

It is the poisoned cup. It is too late.

I dare not drink yet, madam--by and by.

QUEEN  Come, let me wipe thy face.

LAERTES, [to Claudius]
My lord, I'll hit him now.

KING  I do not think 't.

LAERTES, [aside]
And yet it is almost against my conscience.

Come, for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.
I pray you pass with your best violence.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

LAERTES  Say you so? Come on.	[Play.]

OSRIC  Nothing neither way.

LAERTES  Have at you now!
[Laertes wounds Hamlet. Then in scuffling they change
rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]

KING  Part them. They are incensed.

HAMLET  Nay, come again.
[The Queen falls.]

OSRIC  Look to the Queen there, ho!

They bleed on both sides.--How is it, my lord?

OSRIC  How is 't, Laertes?

Why as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
[He falls.]
I am justly killed with mine own treachery.

How does the Queen?

KING  She swoons to see them bleed.

No, no, the drink, the drink! O, my dear Hamlet!
The drink, the drink! I am poisoned.	[She dies.]

O villainy! Ho! Let the door be locked.	[Osric exits.]
Treachery! Seek it out.

It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.
No med'cine in the world can do thee good.
In thee there is not half an hour's life.
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenomed. The foul practice
Hath turned itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
Never to rise again. Thy mother's poisoned.
I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.

The point envenomed too! Then, venom, to thy
work.	[Hurts the King.]

ALL  Treason, treason!

O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.

Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
[Forcing him to drink the poison.]
Follow my mother.	[King dies.]

LAERTES  He is justly served.
It is a poison tempered by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
Nor thine on me.	[Dies.]

Heaven make thee free of it. I follow thee.--
I am dead, Horatio.--Wretched queen, adieu.--
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
Is strict in his arrest), O, I could tell you--
But let it be.--Horatio, I am dead.
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
To the unsatisfied.

HORATIO  Never believe it.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
Here's yet some liquor left.	[He picks up the cup.]

HAMLET  As thou 'rt a man,
Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha 't.
O God, Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
Absent thee from felicity awhile
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
To tell my story.
[A march afar off and shot within.]
What warlike noise is this?

[Enter Osric.]

OSRIC
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
To th' ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley.

HAMLET  O, I die, Horatio!
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
I cannot live to hear the news from England.
But I do prophesy th' election lights
On Fortinbras; he has my dying voice.
So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
Which have solicited--the rest is silence.
O, O, O, O!	[Dies.]

Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.
[March within.]
Why does the drum come hither?

[Enter Fortinbras with the English Ambassadors with
Drum, Colors, and Attendants.]

FORTINBRAS  Where is this sight?

HORATIO  What is it you would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.

This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck?

AMBASSADOR  The sight is dismal,
And our affairs from England come too late.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
To tell him his commandment is fulfilled,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Where should we have our thanks?

HORATIO  Not from his
mouth,
Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Are here arrived, give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view,
And let me speak to th' yet unknowing world
How these things came about. So shall you hear
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
Truly deliver.

FORTINBRAS  Let us haste to hear it
And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.

Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on
But let this same be presently performed
Even while men's minds are wild, lest more
mischance
On plots and errors happen.

FORTINBRAS  Let four captains
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royal; and for his passage,
The soldier's music and the rite of war
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
[They exit, marching, after the which, a peal of
ordnance are shot off.]

[Enter the King, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur,
and Sir Walter Blunt, with others.]

KING, [to Northumberland, Worcester, and Hotspur]
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
Unapt to stir at these indignities,
And you have found me, for accordingly
You tread upon my patience. But be sure
I will from henceforth rather be myself,
Mighty and to be feared, than my condition,
Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
And therefore lost that title of respect
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.

Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
The scourge of greatness to be used on it,
And that same greatness too which our own hands
Have holp to make so portly.


Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see
Danger and disobedience in thine eye.
O sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
And majesty might never yet endure
The moody frontier of a servant brow.
You have good leave to leave us. When we need
Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
[Worcester exits.]
You were about to speak.

NORTHUMBERLAND  Yea, my good lord.
Those prisoners in your Highness' name demanded,
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
As is delivered to your Majesty.
Either envy, therefore, or misprision
Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.

My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
But I remember, when the fight was done,
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
Came there a certain lord, neat and trimly dressed,
Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reaped
Showed like a stubble land at harvest home.
He was perfumed like a milliner,
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncet box, which ever and anon
He gave his nose and took 't away again,
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talked.
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
With many holiday and lady terms
He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded
My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf.
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
To be so pestered with a popinjay,
Out of my grief and my impatience
Answered neglectingly I know not what--
He should, or he should not; for he made me mad
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
Of guns, and drums, and wounds--God save the
mark!--
And telling me the sovereignest thing on Earth
Was parmacety for an inward bruise,
And that it was great pity, so it was,
This villainous saltpeter should be digged
Out of the bowels of the harmless Earth,
Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed
So cowardly, and but for these vile guns
He would himself have been a soldier.
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
I answered indirectly, as I said,
And I beseech you, let not his report
Come current for an accusation
Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.

The circumstance considered, good my lord,
Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
To such a person and in such a place,
At such a time, with all the rest retold,
May reasonably die and never rise
To do him wrong or any way impeach
What then he said, so he unsay it now.

Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
But with proviso and exception
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,
Who, on my soul, hath willfully betrayed
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Against that great magician, damned Glendower,
Whose daughter, as we hear, that Earl of March
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
Shall we buy treason and indent with fears
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
No, on the barren mountains let him starve,
For I shall never hold that man my friend
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.

HOTSPUR  Revolted Mortimer!
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
But by the chance of war. To prove that true
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank
In single opposition hand to hand
He did confound the best part of an hour
In changing hardiment with great Glendower.
Three times they breathed, and three times did they
drink,
Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.
Never did bare and rotten policy
Color her working with such deadly wounds,
Nor never could the noble Mortimer
Receive so many, and all willingly.
Then let not him be slandered with revolt.

Thou dost belie him, Percy; thou dost belie him.
He never did encounter with Glendower.
I tell thee, he durst as well have met the devil alone
As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
As will displease you.--My lord Northumberland,
We license your departure with your son.--
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
[King exits with Blunt and others.]

An if the devil come and roar for them,
I will not send them. I will after straight
And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,
Albeit I make a hazard of my head.

What, drunk with choler? Stay and pause awhile.
Here comes your uncle.

[Enter Worcester.]

HOTSPUR  Speak of Mortimer?
Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul
Want mercy if I do not join with him.
Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer
As high in the air as this unthankful king,
As this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke.

Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.

Who struck this heat up after I was gone?

He will forsooth have all my prisoners,
And when I urged the ransom once again
Of my wife's brother, then his cheek looked pale,
And on my face he turned an eye of death,
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.

I cannot blame him. Was not he proclaimed
By Richard, that dead is, the next of blood?

He was; I heard the proclamation.
And then it was when the unhappy king--
Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
Upon his Irish expedition;
From whence he, intercepted, did return
To be deposed and shortly murdered.

And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
Live scandalized and foully spoken of.

But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
Heir to the crown?

NORTHUMBERLAND  He did; myself did hear it.

Nay then, I cannot blame his cousin king
That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
But shall it be that you that set the crown
Upon the head of this forgetful man
And for his sake wear the detested blot
Of murderous subornation--shall it be
That you a world of curses undergo,
Being the agents or base second means,
The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
O, pardon me that I descend so low
To show the line and the predicament
Wherein you range under this subtle king.
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
That men of your nobility and power
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf
(As both of you, God pardon it, have done)
To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
And shall it in more shame be further spoken
That you are fooled, discarded, and shook off
By him for whom these shames you underwent?
No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem
Your banished honors and restore yourselves
Into the good thoughts of the world again,
Revenge the jeering and disdained contempt
Of this proud king, who studies day and night
To answer all the debt he owes to you
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths.
Therefore I say--

WORCESTER  Peace, cousin, say no more.
And now I will unclasp a secret book,
And to your quick-conceiving discontents
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
As full of peril and adventurous spirit
As to o'erwalk a current roaring loud
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.

If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim!
Send danger from the east unto the west,
So honor cross it from the north to south,
And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs
To rouse a lion than to start a hare!

NORTHUMBERLAND, [to Worcester]
Imagination of some great exploit
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.

By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap
To pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
Where fathom line could never touch the ground,
And pluck up drowned honor by the locks,
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
Without corrival all her dignities.
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!

He apprehends a world of figures here,
But not the form of what he should attend.--
Good cousin, give me audience for a while.

I cry you mercy.

WORCESTER  Those same noble Scots
That are your prisoners--

HOTSPUR  I'll keep them all.
By God, he shall not have a Scot of them.
No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not.
I'll keep them, by this hand!

WORCESTER  You start away
And lend no ear unto my purposes:
Those prisoners you shall keep--

HOTSPUR  Nay, I will. That's flat!
He said he would not ransom Mortimer,
Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer.
But I will find him when he lies asleep,
And in his ear I'll hollo "Mortimer."
Nay, I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
Nothing but "Mortimer," and give it him
To keep his anger still in motion.

WORCESTER  Hear you, cousin, a word.

All studies here I solemnly defy,
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke.
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales--
But that I think his father loves him not
And would be glad he met with some mischance--
I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale.

Farewell, kinsman. I'll talk to you
When you are better tempered to attend.

NORTHUMBERLAND, [to Hotspur]
Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!

Why, look you, I am whipped and scourged with
rods,
Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
In Richard's time--what do you call the place?
A plague upon it! It is in Gloucestershire.
'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
His uncle York, where I first bowed my knee
Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke.
'Sblood, when you and he came back from
Ravenspurgh.

NORTHUMBERLAND  At Berkeley Castle.

HOTSPUR  You say true.
Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me:
"Look when his infant fortune came to age,"
And "gentle Harry Percy," and "kind cousin."
O, the devil take such cozeners!--God forgive me!
Good uncle, tell your tale. I have done.

Nay, if you have not, to it again.
We will stay your leisure.

HOTSPUR  I have done, i' faith.

Then once more to your Scottish prisoners:
Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
And make the Douglas' son your only mean
For powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasons
Which I shall send you written, be assured
Will easily be granted.--You, my lord,
Your son in Scotland being thus employed,
Shall secretly into the bosom creep
Of that same noble prelate well beloved,
The Archbishop.

HOTSPUR  Of York, is it not?

WORCESTER  True, who bears hard
His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
I speak not this in estimation,
As what I think might be, but what I know
Is ruminated, plotted, and set down,
And only stays but to behold the face
Of that occasion that shall bring it on.

I smell it. Upon my life it will do well.

Before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip.

Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.
And then the power of Scotland and of York
To join with Mortimer, ha?

WORCESTER  And so they shall.

In faith, it is exceedingly well aimed.

And 'tis no little reason bids us speed
To save our heads by raising of a head,
For bear ourselves as even as we can,
The King will always think him in our debt,
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
Till he hath found a time to pay us home.
And see already how he doth begin
To make us strangers to his looks of love.

He does, he does. We'll be revenged on him.

Cousin, farewell. No further go in this
Than I by letters shall direct your course.
When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
As I will fashion it, shall happily meet
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
Which now we hold at much uncertainty.

Farewell, good brother. We shall thrive, I trust.

Uncle, adieu. O, let the hours be short
Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport.


[Enter the King, Prince of Wales, and others.]

Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
Must have some private conference, but be near at
hand,
For we shall presently have need of you.
I know not whether God will have it so
For some displeasing service I have done,
That, in His secret doom, out of my blood
He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me.
But thou dost in thy passages of life
Make me believe that thou art only marked
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
Could such inordinate and low desires,
Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean
attempts,
Such barren pleasures, rude society
As thou art matched withal, and grafted to,
Accompany the greatness of thy blood,
And hold their level with thy princely heart?

So please your Majesty, I would I could
Quit all offenses with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal.
Yet such extenuation let me beg
As, in reproof of many tales devised,
Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers,
I may for some things true, wherein my youth
Hath faulty wandered and irregular,
Find pardon on my true submission.

God pardon thee. Yet let me wonder, Harry,
At thy affections, which do hold a wing
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost,
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
And art almost an alien to the hearts
Of all the court and princes of my blood.
The hope and expectation of thy time
Is ruined, and the soul of every man
Prophetically do forethink thy fall.
Had I so lavish of my presence been,
So common-hackneyed in the eyes of men,
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
Had still kept loyal to possession
And left me in reputeless banishment,
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
By being seldom seen, I could not stir
But like a comet I was wondered at,
That men would tell their children "This is he."
Others would say "Where? Which is Bolingbroke?"
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
And dressed myself in such humility
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
Even in the presence of the crowned king.
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,
My presence, like a robe pontifical,
Ne'er seen but wondered at, and so my state,
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
And won by rareness such solemnity.
The skipping king, he ambled up and down
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
Mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools,
Had his great name profaned with their scorns,
And gave his countenance, against his name,
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
Of every beardless vain comparative;
Grew a companion to the common streets,
Enfeoffed himself to popularity,
That, being daily swallowed by men's eyes,
They surfeited with honey and began
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
More than a little is by much too much.
So, when he had occasion to be seen,
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
As, sick and blunted with community,
Afford no extraordinary gaze
Such as is bent on sunlike majesty
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes,
But rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down,
Slept in his face, and rendered such aspect
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
Being with his presence glutted, gorged, and full.
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,
For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
With vile participation. Not an eye
But is aweary of thy common sight,
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more,
Which now doth that I would not have it do,
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
Be more myself.

KING  For all the world
As thou art to this hour was Richard then
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
And even as I was then is Percy now.
Now, by my scepter, and my soul to boot,
He hath more worthy interest to the state
Than thou, the shadow of succession.
For of no right, nor color like to right,
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
What never-dying honor hath he got
Against renowned Douglas, whose high deeds,
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms,
Holds from all soldiers chief majority
And military title capital
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swaddling
clothes,
This infant warrior, in his enterprises
Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
Enlarged him, and made a friend of him,
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
The Archbishop's Grace of York, Douglas,
Mortimer,
Capitulate against us and are up.
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
Which art my nearest and dearest enemy?
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
Base inclination, and the start of spleen,
To fight against me under Percy's pay,
To dog his heels, and curtsy at his frowns,
To show how much thou art degenerate.

Do not think so. You shall not find it so.
And God forgive them that so much have swayed
Your Majesty's good thoughts away from me.
I will redeem all this on Percy's head,
And, in the closing of some glorious day,
Be bold to tell you that I am your son,
When I will wear a garment all of blood
And stain my favors in a bloody mask,
Which, washed away, shall scour my shame with it.
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
That this same child of honor and renown,
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
For every honor sitting on his helm,
Would they were multitudes, and on my head
My shames redoubled! For the time will come
That I shall make this northern youth exchange
His glorious deeds for my indignities.
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf.
And I will call him to so strict account
That he shall render every glory up,
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
This in the name of God I promise here,
The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
I do beseech your Majesty may salve
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance.
If not, the end of life cancels all bands,
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

A hundred thousand rebels die in this.
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.

[Enter Blunt.]

How now, good Blunt? Thy looks are full of speed.

So hath the business that I come to speak of.
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
That Douglas and the English rebels met
The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
If promises be kept on every hand,
As ever offered foul play in a state.

The Earl of Westmoreland set forth today,
With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster,
For this advertisement is five days old.--
On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward.
On Thursday we ourselves will march. Our meeting
Is Bridgenorth. And, Harry, you shall march
Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
Our business valued, some twelve days hence
Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
Our hands are full of business. Let's away.
Advantage feeds him fat while men delay.

[Enter Francis and another Drawer.]

FRANCIS  What the devil hast thou brought there--
applejohns? Thou knowest Sir John cannot endure
an applejohn.

SECOND DRAWER  Mass, thou sayst true. The Prince
once set a dish of applejohns before him and told
him there were five more Sir Johns and, putting off
his hat, said "I will now take my leave of these six
dry, round, old, withered knights." It angered him
to the heart. But he hath forgot that.

FRANCIS  Why then, cover and set them down, and see if
thou canst find out Sneak's noise. Mistress Tearsheet
would fain hear some music. Dispatch. The
room where they supped is too hot. They'll come in

[Enter Will.]

WILL  Sirrah, here will be the Prince and Master
Poins anon, and they will put on two of our jerkins
and aprons, and Sir John must not know of it.
Bardolph hath brought word.

SECOND DRAWER  By the Mass, here will be old utis. It
will be an excellent stratagem.

FRANCIS  I'll see if I can find out Sneak.
[He exits with the Second Drawer.]

[Enter Hostess and Doll Tearsheet.]

HOSTESS  I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in
an excellent good temperality. Your pulsidge beats
as extraordinarily as heart would desire, and your
color, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good
truth, la. But, i' faith, you have drunk too much
canaries, and that's a marvellous searching wine,
and it perfumes the blood ere one can say "What's
this?" How do you now?

DOLL  Better than I was. Hem.

HOSTESS  Why, that's well said. A good heart's worth
gold. Lo, here comes Sir John.


FALSTAFF, [singing]
When Arthur first in court--
[To Will.] Empty the jordan.	[Will exits.]
And was a worthy king--
How now, Mistress Doll?

HOSTESS  Sick of a calm, yea, good faith.

FALSTAFF  So is all her sect. An they be once in a calm,
they are sick.

DOLL  A pox damn you, you muddy rascal. Is that all the
comfort you give me?

FALSTAFF  You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.

DOLL  I make them? Gluttony and diseases make them;
I make them not.

FALSTAFF  If the cook help to make the gluttony, you
help to make the diseases, Doll. We catch of you,
Doll, we catch of you. Grant that, my poor virtue,
grant that.

DOLL  Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.

FALSTAFF  Your brooches, pearls, and ouches--for to
serve bravely is to come halting off, you know; to
come off the breach with his pike bent bravely, and
to surgery bravely, to venture upon the charged
chambers bravely--

DOLL  Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!

HOSTESS  By my troth, this is the old fashion. You two
never meet but you fall to some discord. You are
both, i' good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts.
You cannot one bear with another's confirmities.
What the good-year! One must bear, and [to Doll]
that must be you. You are the weaker vessel, as they
say, the emptier vessel.

DOLL  Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full
hogshead? There's a whole merchant's venture of
Bordeaux stuff in him. You have not seen a hulk
better stuffed in the hold.--Come, I'll be friends
with thee, Jack. Thou art going to the wars, and
whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is
nobody cares.

[Enter Drawer.]

DRAWER  Sir, Ancient Pistol's below and would speak

DOLL  Hang him, swaggering rascal! Let him not come
hither. It is the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England.

HOSTESS  If he swagger, let him not come here. No, by
my faith, I must live among my neighbors. I'll no
swaggerers. I am in good name and fame with the
very best. Shut the door. There comes no swaggerers
here. I have not lived all this while to have
swaggering now. Shut the door, I pray you.

FALSTAFF  Dost thou hear, hostess?

HOSTESS  Pray you pacify yourself, Sir John. There
comes no swaggerers here.

FALSTAFF  Dost thou hear? It is mine ancient.

HOSTESS  Tilly-vally, Sir John, ne'er tell me. And your
ancient swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was
before Master Tisick the debuty t' other day, and, as
he said to me--'twas no longer ago than Wednesday
last, i' good faith--"Neighbor Quickly," says
he--Master Dumb, our minister, was by then--
"Neighbor Quickly," says he, "receive those that
are civil, for," said he, "you are in an ill name."
Now he said so, I can tell whereupon. "For," says
he, "you are an honest woman, and well thought
on. Therefore take heed what guests you receive.
Receive," says he, "no swaggering companions."
There comes none here. You would bless you to
hear what he said. No, I'll no swaggerers.

FALSTAFF  He's no swaggerer, hostess, a tame cheater, i'
faith. You may stroke him as gently as a puppy
greyhound. He'll not swagger with a Barbary hen if
her feathers turn back in any show of resistance.--
Call him up, drawer.	[Drawer exits.]

HOSTESS  "Cheater" call you him? I will bar no honest
man my house, nor no cheater, but I do not love
swaggering. By my troth, I am the worse when one
says "swagger." Feel, masters, how I shake; look
you, I warrant you.

DOLL  So you do, hostess.

HOSTESS  Do I? Yea, in very truth, do I, an 'twere an
aspen leaf. I cannot abide swaggerers.

[Enter Ancient Pistol, Bardolph, and Page.]

PISTOL  God save you, Sir John.

FALSTAFF  Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I
charge you with a cup of sack. Do you discharge
upon mine hostess.

PISTOL  I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two
bullets.

FALSTAFF  She is pistol-proof. Sir, you shall not hardly
offend her.

HOSTESS  Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets. I'll
drink no more than will do me good, for no man's
pleasure, I.

PISTOL  Then, to you, Mistress Dorothy! I will charge

DOLL  Charge me? I scorn you, scurvy companion.
What, you poor, base, rascally, cheating lack-linen
mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for
your master.

PISTOL  I know you, Mistress Dorothy.

DOLL  Away, you cutpurse rascal, you filthy bung, away!
By this wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy
chaps an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away,
you bottle-ale rascal, you basket-hilt stale juggler,
you. Since when, I pray you, sir? God's light, with
two points on your shoulder? Much!

PISTOL  God let me not live but I will murder your ruff
for this.

FALSTAFF  No more, Pistol. I would not have you go off
here. Discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.

HOSTESS  No, good Captain Pistol, not here, sweet
captain!

DOLL  Captain? Thou abominable damned cheater, art
thou not ashamed to be called captain? An captains
were of my mind, they would truncheon you out for
taking their names upon you before you have
earned them. You a captain? You slave, for what?
For tearing a poor whore's ruff in a bawdy house?
He a captain! Hang him, rogue. He lives upon
mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain?
God's light, these villains will make the word as
odious as the word "occupy," which was an excellent
good word before it was ill sorted. Therefore
captains had need look to 't.

BARDOLPH, [to Pistol]  Pray thee go down, good ancient.

FALSTAFF  Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.

PISTOL, [to Bardolph]  Not I. I tell thee what, Corporal
Bardolph, I could tear her. I'll be revenged of her.

PAGE  Pray thee go down.

PISTOL  I'll see her damned first to Pluto's damned
lake, by this hand, to th' infernal deep with Erebus
and tortures vile also. Hold hook and line, say I.
Down, down, dogs! Down, Fates! Have we not
Hiren here?	[He draws his sword.]

HOSTESS  Good Captain Peesell, be quiet. 'Tis very late,
i' faith. I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.

PISTOL  These be good humors indeed. Shall pack-horses
and hollow pampered jades of Asia, which
cannot go but thirty mile a day, compare with
Caesars and with cannibals and Troyant Greeks?
Nay, rather damn them with King Cerberus, and let
the welkin roar. Shall we fall foul for toys?

HOSTESS  By my troth, captain, these are very bitter

BARDOLPH  Begone, good ancient. This will grow to a
brawl anon.

PISTOL  Die men like dogs! Give crowns like pins! Have
we not Hiren here?

HOSTESS  O' my word, captain, there's none such here.
What the good-year, do you think I would deny her?
For God's sake, be quiet.

PISTOL  Then feed and be fat, my fair Calipolis. Come,
give 's some sack. Si fortune me tormente, sperato
me contento. Fear we broadsides? No, let the fiend
give fire. Give me some sack, and, sweetheart, lie
thou there. [Laying down his sword.] Come we to
full points here? And are etceteras nothings?

FALSTAFF  Pistol, I would be quiet.

PISTOL  Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf. What, we have
seen the seven stars.

DOLL  For God's sake, thrust him downstairs. I cannot
endure such a fustian rascal.

PISTOL  "Thrust him downstairs"? Know we not Galloway
nags?

FALSTAFF  Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat
shilling. Nay, an he do nothing but speak
nothing, he shall be nothing here.

BARDOLPH  Come, get you downstairs.

PISTOL, [taking up his sword]  What, shall we have
incision? Shall we imbrue? Then death rock me
asleep, abridge my doleful days. Why then, let
grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds untwind the Sisters
Three. Come, Atropos, I say.

HOSTESS  Here's goodly stuff toward!

FALSTAFF  Give me my rapier, boy.

DOLL  I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee do not draw.

FALSTAFF, [to Pistol]  Get you downstairs.	[They fight.]

HOSTESS  Here's a goodly tumult. I'll forswear keeping
house afore I'll be in these tirrits and frights. So,
murder, I warrant now. Alas, alas, put up your
naked weapons, put up your naked weapons.
[Bardolph and Pistol exit.]

DOLL  I pray thee, Jack, be quiet. The rascal's gone. Ah,
you whoreson little valiant villain, you.

HOSTESS, [to Falstaff]  Are you not hurt i' th' groin?
Methought he made a shrewd thrust at your belly.


FALSTAFF  Have you turned him out o' doors?

BARDOLPH  Yea, sir. The rascal's drunk. You have hurt
him, sir, i' th' shoulder.

FALSTAFF  A rascal to brave me!

DOLL  Ah, you sweet little rogue, you. Alas, poor ape,
how thou sweat'st! Come, let me wipe thy face.
Come on, you whoreson chops. Ah, rogue, i' faith, I
love thee. Thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy,
worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better
than the Nine Worthies. Ah, villain!

FALSTAFF  Ah, rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a
blanket.

DOLL  Do, an thou darest for thy heart. An thou dost, I'll
canvass thee between a pair of sheets.

[Enter Musicians and Francis.]

PAGE  The music is come, sir.

FALSTAFF  Let them play.--Play, sirs.--Sit on my knee,
Doll. A rascal bragging slave! The rogue fled from
me like quicksilver.

DOLL  I' faith, and thou followed'st him like a church.
Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig,
when wilt thou leave fighting a-days and foining a-nights
and begin to patch up thine old body for
heaven?

[Enter behind them Prince and Poins disguised.]

FALSTAFF  Peace, good Doll. Do not speak like a death's-head;
do not bid me remember mine end.

DOLL  Sirrah, what humor's the Prince of?

FALSTAFF  A good shallow young fellow, he would have
made a good pantler; he would 'a chipped bread

DOLL  They say Poins has a good wit.

FALSTAFF  He a good wit? Hang him, baboon. His wit's
as thick as Tewkesbury mustard. There's no more
conceit in him than is in a mallet.

DOLL  Why does the Prince love him so then?

FALSTAFF  Because their legs are both of a bigness, and
he plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel,
and drinks off candles' ends for flap-dragons, and
rides the wild mare with the boys, and jumps upon
joint stools, and swears with a good grace, and
wears his boots very smooth like unto the sign of
the Leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet
stories, and such other gambol faculties he has that
show a weak mind and an able body, for the which
the Prince admits him; for the Prince himself is
such another. The weight of a hair will turn the
scales between their avoirdupois.

PRINCE, [aside to Poins]  Would not this nave of a wheel
have his ears cut off?

POINS  Let's beat him before his whore.

PRINCE  Look whe'er the withered elder hath not his
poll clawed like a parrot.

POINS  Is it not strange that desire should so many years
outlive performance?

FALSTAFF  Kiss me, Doll.

PRINCE, [aside to Poins]  Saturn and Venus this year in
conjunction! What says th' almanac to that?

POINS  And look whether the fiery trigon, his man, be
not lisping to his master's old tables, his notebook,
his counsel keeper.

FALSTAFF, [to Doll]  Thou dost give me flattering busses.

DOLL  By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant

FALSTAFF  I am old, I am old.

DOLL  I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young
boy of them all.

FALSTAFF  What stuff wilt thou have a kirtle of? I shall
receive money o' Thursday; thou shalt have a cap
tomorrow. A merry song! Come, it grows late. We'll
to bed. Thou 'lt forget me when I am gone.

DOLL  By my troth, thou 'lt set me a-weeping an thou
sayst so. Prove that ever I dress myself handsome till
thy return. Well, harken a' th' end.

FALSTAFF  Some sack, Francis.

PRINCE, POINS, [coming forward]  Anon, anon, sir.

FALSTAFF  Ha? A bastard son of the King's?--And art
not thou Poins his brother?

PRINCE  Why, thou globe of sinful continents, what a
life dost thou lead?

FALSTAFF  A better than thou. I am a gentleman. Thou
art a drawer.

PRINCE  Very true, sir, and I come to draw you out by
the ears.

HOSTESS  O, the Lord preserve thy good Grace! By my
troth, welcome to London. Now the Lord bless that
sweet face of thine. O Jesu, are you come from
Wales?

FALSTAFF, [to Prince]  Thou whoreson mad compound
of majesty, by this light flesh and corrupt blood,
thou art welcome.

DOLL  How? You fat fool, I scorn you.

POINS  My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge
and turn all to a merriment if you take not the heat.

PRINCE, [to Falstaff]  You whoreson candle-mine, you,
how vilely did you speak of me even now before
this honest, virtuous, civil gentlewoman!

HOSTESS  God's blessing of your good heart, and so she
is, by my troth.

FALSTAFF, [to Prince]  Didst thou hear me?

PRINCE  Yea, and you knew me as you did when you ran
away by Gad's Hill. You knew I was at your back,
and spoke it on purpose to try my patience.

FALSTAFF  No, no, no, not so. I did not think thou wast
within hearing.

PRINCE  I shall drive you, then, to confess the wilfull
abuse, and then I know how to handle you.

FALSTAFF  No abuse, Hal, o' mine honor, no abuse.

PRINCE  Not to dispraise me and call me pantler and
bread-chipper and I know not what?

FALSTAFF  No abuse, Hal.

POINS  No abuse?

FALSTAFF  No abuse, Ned, i' th' world, honest Ned,
none. I dispraised him before the wicked, [(to
Prince)] that the wicked might not fall in love with
thee; in which doing, I have done the part of a
careful friend and a true subject, and thy father is to
give me thanks for it. No abuse, Hal.--None, Ned,
none. No, faith, boys, none.

PRINCE  See now whether pure fear and entire cowardice
doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman
to close with us. Is she of the wicked, is
thine hostess here of the wicked, or is thy boy of the
wicked, or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in
his nose, of the wicked?

POINS  Answer, thou dead elm, answer.

FALSTAFF  The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable,
and his face is Lucifer's privy kitchen,
where he doth nothing but roast malt-worms. For
the boy, there is a good angel about him, but the
devil blinds him too.

PRINCE  For the women?

FALSTAFF  For one of them, she's in hell already and
burns poor souls. For th' other, I owe her money,
and whether she be damned for that I know not.

HOSTESS  No, I warrant you.

FALSTAFF  No, I think thou art not. I think thou art quit
for that. Marry, there is another indictment upon
thee for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house
contrary to the law, for the which I think thou wilt
howl.

HOSTESS  All vitlars do so. What's a joint of mutton or
two in a whole Lent?

PRINCE, [to Doll]  You, gentlewoman.

DOLL  What says your Grace?

FALSTAFF  His grace says that which his flesh rebels
against.
[Peto knocks at door.]

HOSTESS  Who knocks so loud at door? Look to th' door
there, Francis.	[Francis exits.]

[Enter Peto.]

PRINCE  Peto, how now, what news?

PETO
The King your father is at Westminster,
And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
Come from the north, and as I came along
I met and overtook a dozen captains,
Bareheaded, sweating, knocking at the taverns
And asking everyone for Sir John Falstaff.

By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame
So idly to profane the precious time
When tempest of commotion, like the south
Borne with black vapor, doth begin to melt
And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.--
Give me my sword and cloak.--Falstaff, good
night.	[Prince, Peto, and Poins exit.]

FALSTAFF  Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the
night, and we must hence and leave it unpicked.

[(Knocking. Bardolph exits.)] More knocking at the
door? [(Bardolph returns.)] How now, what's the

BARDOLPH
You must away to court, sir, presently.
A dozen captains stay at door for you.

FALSTAFF, [to Page]  Pay the musicians, sirrah.--
Farewell, hostess.--Farewell, Doll. You see, my
good wenches, how men of merit are sought after.
The undeserver may sleep when the man of action
is called on. Farewell, good wenches. If I be not sent
away post, I will see you again ere I go.

DOLL  I cannot speak. If my heart be not ready to
burst--well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.

FALSTAFF  Farewell, farewell.
[He exits with Bardolph, Page, and Musicians.]

HOSTESS  Well, fare thee well. I have known thee these
twenty-nine years, come peasecod time, but an
honester and truer-hearted man--well, fare thee

BARDOLPH, [within]  Mistress Tearsheet!

HOSTESS  What's the matter?

BARDOLPH, [within]  Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my

HOSTESS  O, run, Doll, run, run, good Doll. Come.--
She comes blubbered.--Yea! Will you come, Doll?

[Enter the King of England and all his train
before the gates.]

KING HENRY, [to the men of Harfleur]
How yet resolves the Governor of the town?
This is the latest parle we will admit.
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
Or, like to men proud of destruction,
Defy us to our worst. For, as I am a soldier,
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
If I begin the batt'ry once again,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
Till in her ashes she lie buried.
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart,
In liberty of bloody hand, shall range
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants.
What is it then to me if impious war,
Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends,
Do with his smirched complexion all fell feats
Enlinked to waste and desolation?
What is 't to me, when you yourselves are cause,
If your pure maidens fall into the hand
Of hot and forcing violation?
What rein can hold licentious wickedness
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
We may as bootless spend our vain command
Upon th' enraged soldiers in their spoil
As send precepts to the Leviathan
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
Take pity of your town and of your people
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command,
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
Of heady murder, spoil, and villainy.
If not, why, in a moment look to see
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
Desire the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters,
Your fathers taken by the silver beards
And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls,
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
What say you? Will you yield and this avoid
Or, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed?

[Enter Governor.]

GOVERNOR
Our expectation hath this day an end.
The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,
Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,
We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
Enter our gates, dispose of us and ours,
For we no longer are defensible.

Open your gates.	[Governor exits.]
Come, uncle Exeter,
Go you and enter Harfleur. There remain,
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French.
Use mercy to them all for us, dear uncle.
The winter coming on and sickness growing
Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest.
Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.
[Flourish, and enter the town.]

[Enter Captains, English and Welsh, Gower and Fluellen.]

GOWER  How now, Captain Fluellen? Come you from
the bridge?

FLUELLEN  I assure you there is very excellent services
committed at the bridge.

GOWER  Is the Duke of Exeter safe?

FLUELLEN  The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as
Agamemnon, and a man that I love and honor with
my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and
my living and my uttermost power. He is not, God
be praised and blessed, any hurt in the world, but
keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent
discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant there at
the pridge; I think in my very conscience he is as
valiant a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no
estimation in the world, but I did see him do as
gallant service.

GOWER  What do you call him?

FLUELLEN  He is called Aunchient Pistol.

GOWER  I know him not.


FLUELLEN  Here is the man.

PISTOL  Captain, I thee beseech to do me favors. The
Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.

FLUELLEN  Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some
love at his hands.

PISTOL  Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart and
of buxom valor, hath, by cruel Fate and giddy
Fortune's furious fickle wheel, that goddess blind,
that stands upon the rolling restless stone--

FLUELLEN  By your patience, Aunchient Pistol, Fortune
is painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to
signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is
painted also with a wheel to signify to you, which is
the moral of it, that she is turning and inconstant,
and mutability and variation; and her foot, look you,
is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls and rolls
and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most
excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent
moral.

PISTOL  Fortune is Bardolph's foe and frowns on him,
for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must he be. A
damned death! Let gallows gape for dog, let man go
free, and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate. But
Exeter hath given the doom of death for pax of little
price. Therefore go speak; the Duke will hear thy
voice, and let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
with edge of penny cord and vile reproach. Speak,
captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.

FLUELLEN  Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand
your meaning.

PISTOL  Why then, rejoice therefore.

FLUELLEN  Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to
rejoice at, for if, look you, he were my brother, I
would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure and
put him to execution, for discipline ought to be
used.

PISTOL  Die and be damned, and figo for thy friendship!

FLUELLEN  It is well.

PISTOL  The fig of Spain!	[He exits.]

FLUELLEN  Very good.

GOWER  Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal. I
remember him now, a bawd, a cutpurse.

FLUELLEN  I'll assure you he uttered as prave words at
the pridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it
is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well, I
warrant you, when time is serve.

GOWER  Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and
then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return
into London under the form of a soldier; and such
fellows are perfect in the great commanders'
names, and they will learn you by rote where
services were done--at such and such a sconce, at
such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off
bravely, who was shot, who disgraced, what terms
the enemy stood on; and this they con perfectly in
the phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned
oaths; and what a beard of the general's cut
and a horrid suit of the camp will do among
foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to
be thought on. But you must learn to know such
slanders of the age, or else you may be marvelously
mistook.

FLUELLEN  I tell you what, Captain Gower. I do perceive
he is not the man that he would gladly make
show to the world he is. If I find a hole in his coat, I
will tell him my mind.

[Drum and Colors. Enter the King of England and his
poor Soldiers, and Gloucester.]

Hark you, the King is coming, and I must speak
with him from the pridge.--God pless your

KING HENRY  How now, Fluellen, cam'st thou from the
bridge?

FLUELLEN  Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of
Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge.
The French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant
and most prave passages. Marry, th' athversary was
have possession of the pridge, but he is enforced
to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the
pridge. I can tell your Majesty, the Duke is a prave

KING HENRY  What men have you lost, Fluellen?

FLUELLEN  The perdition of th' athversary hath been
very great, reasonable great. Marry, for my part, I
think the Duke hath lost never a man but one that is
like to be executed for robbing a church, one
Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man. His face is
all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o'
fire; and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a
coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red, but
his nose is executed, and his fire's out.

KING HENRY  We would have all such offenders so cut
off; and we give express charge that in our marches
through the country there be nothing compelled
from the villages, nothing taken but paid for,
none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful
language; for when lenity and cruelty play
for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest
winner.


MONTJOY  You know me by my habit.

KING HENRY  Well then, I know thee. What shall I know
of thee?

MONTJOY  My master's mind.

KING HENRY  Unfold it.

MONTJOY  Thus says my king: "Say thou to Harry of
England, though we seemed dead, we did but sleep.
Advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him
we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full
ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is
imperial. England shall repent his folly, see his
weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him
therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion
the losses we have borne, the subjects we
have lost, the disgrace we have digested, which, in
weight to reanswer, his pettiness would bow under.
For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th'
effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom
too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own
person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless
satisfaction. To this, add defiance, and tell him,
for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers,
whose condemnation is pronounced." So far my
king and master; so much my office.

What is thy name? I know thy quality.

MONTJOY  Montjoy.

Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,
And tell thy king I do not seek him now
But could be willing to march on to Calais
Without impeachment, for, to say the sooth,
Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
My numbers lessened, and those few I have
Almost no better than so many French,
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
I thought upon one pair of English legs
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgive me, God,
That I do brag thus. This your air of France
Hath blown that vice in me. I must repent.
Go therefore, tell thy master: here I am.
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
My army but a weak and sickly guard,
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on
Though France himself and such another neighbor
Stand in our way. There's for thy labor, Montjoy.
[Gives money.]
Go bid thy master well advise himself:
If we may pass, we will; if we be hindered,
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
Discolor. And so, Montjoy, fare you well.
The sum of all our answer is but this:
We would not seek a battle as we are,
Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.
So tell your master.

I shall deliver so. Thanks to your Highness.

I hope they will not come upon us now.

We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.
March to the bridge. It now draws toward night.
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,
And on tomorrow bid them march away.


FLUELLEN  Kill the poys and the luggage! 'Tis expressly
against the law of arms. 'Tis as arrant a piece of
knavery, mark you now, as can be offert, in your
conscience now, is it not?

GOWER  'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive, and
the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha'
done this slaughter. Besides, they have burned
and carried away all that was in the King's tent,
wherefore the King, most worthily, hath caused
every soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a
gallant king!

FLUELLEN  Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain
Gower. What call you the town's name where
Alexander the Pig was born?

GOWER  Alexander the Great.

FLUELLEN  Why, I pray you, is not "pig" great? The pig,
or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the
magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the
phrase is a little variations.

GOWER  I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon.
His father was called Philip of Macedon, as I

FLUELLEN  I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is
porn. I tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of
the 'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons
between Macedon and Monmouth, that the
situations, look you, is both alike. There is a river in
Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at
Monmouth. It is called Wye at Monmouth, but it is
out of my prains what is the name of the other river.
But 'tis all one; 'tis alike as my fingers is to my
fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you mark
Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life is
come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in
all things. Alexander, God knows and you know, in
his rages and his furies and his wraths and his
cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his
indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in
his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you,
kill his best friend, Cleitus.

GOWER  Our king is not like him in that. He never
killed any of his friends.

FLUELLEN  It is not well done, mark you now, to take
the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and
finished. I speak but in the figures and comparisons
of it. As Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in
his ales and his cups, so also Harry Monmouth,
being in his right wits and his good judgments,
turned away the fat knight with the great-belly
doublet; he was full of jests and gipes and knaveries
and mocks--I have forgot his name.

GOWER  Sir John Falstaff.

FLUELLEN  That is he. I'll tell you, there is good men
porn at Monmouth.

GOWER  Here comes his Majesty.

[Alarum. Enter King Harry, Exeter, Warwick, Gloucester,
Heralds and Bourbon with other prisoners. Flourish.]

I was not angry since I came to France
Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald.
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill.
If they will fight with us, bid them come down,
Or void the field. They do offend our sight.
If they'll do neither, we will come to them
And make them skirr away as swift as stones
Enforced from the old Assyrian slings.
Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,
And not a man of them that we shall take
Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.

[Enter Montjoy.]

Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.

His eyes are humbler than they used to be.

How now, what means this, herald? Know'st thou
That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
Com'st thou again for ransom?

MONTJOY  No, great king.
I come to thee for charitable license,
That we may wander o'er this bloody field
To book our dead and then to bury them,
To sort our nobles from our common men,
For many of our princes--woe the while!--
Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood.
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
In blood of princes, and the wounded steeds
Fret fetlock deep in gore, and with wild rage
Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,
Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,
To view the field in safety and dispose
Of their dead bodies.

KING HENRY  I tell thee truly, herald,
I know not if the day be ours or no,
For yet a many of your horsemen peer
And gallop o'er the field.

MONTJOY  The day is yours.

Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
What is this castle called that stands hard by?

MONTJOY  They call it Agincourt.

Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.

FLUELLEN  Your grandfather of famous memory, an 't
please your Majesty, and your great-uncle Edward
the Plack Prince of Wales, as I have read in the
chronicles, fought a most prave pattle here in

KING HENRY  They did, Fluellen.

FLUELLEN  Your Majesty says very true. If your Majesties
is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good
service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing
leeks in their Monmouth caps, which, your Majesty
know, to this hour is an honorable badge of the
service. And I do believe your Majesty takes no
scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's day.

I wear it for a memorable honor,
For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.

FLUELLEN  All the water in Wye cannot wash your
Majesty's Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell
you that. God pless it and preserve it as long as it
pleases his Grace and his Majesty too.

KING HENRY  Thanks, good my countryman.

FLUELLEN  By Jeshu, I am your Majesty's countryman,
I care not who know it. I will confess it to all the
'orld. I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty,
praised be God, so long as your Majesty is an
honest man.

God keep me so.--Our heralds, go with him.
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead
On both our parts.
[Montjoy, English Heralds, and Gower exit.]

[Enter Williams.]

Call yonder fellow hither.

EXETER  Soldier, you must come to the King.

KING HENRY  Soldier, why wear'st thou that glove in thy
cap?

WILLIAMS  An 't please your Majesty, 'tis the gage of
one that I should fight withal, if he be alive.

KING HENRY  An Englishman?

WILLIAMS  An 't please your Majesty, a rascal that
swaggered with me last night, who, if alive and ever
dare to challenge this glove, I have sworn to take
him a box o' th' ear, or if I can see my glove in his
cap, which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would
wear if alive, I will strike it out soundly.

KING HENRY  What think you, Captain Fluellen, is it fit
this soldier keep his oath?

FLUELLEN  He is a craven and a villain else, an 't
please your Majesty, in my conscience.

KING HENRY  It may be his enemy is a gentleman of
great sort, quite from the answer of his degree.

FLUELLEN  Though he be as good a gentleman as the
devil is, as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself, it is
necessary, look your Grace, that he keep his vow
and his oath. If he be perjured, see you now, his
reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as
ever his black shoe trod upon God's ground and His
earth, in my conscience, la.

KING HENRY  Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou
meet'st the fellow.

WILLIAMS  So I will, my liege, as I live.

KING HENRY  Who serv'st thou under?

WILLIAMS  Under Captain Gower, my liege.

FLUELLEN  Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge
and literatured in the wars.

KING HENRY  Call him hither to me, soldier.

WILLIAMS  I will, my liege.	[He exits.]

KING HENRY, [giving Fluellen Williams's glove]  Here,
Fluellen, wear thou this favor for me, and stick it in
thy cap. When Alencon and myself were down
together, I plucked this glove from his helm. If any
man challenge this, he is a friend to Alencon and an
enemy to our person. If thou encounter any such,
apprehend him, an thou dost me love.

FLUELLEN, [putting the glove in his cap]  Your Grace
does me as great honors as can be desired in the
hearts of his subjects. I would fain see the man that
has but two legs that shall find himself aggriefed at
this glove, that is all; but I would fain see it once, an
please God of His grace that I might see.

KING HENRY  Know'st thou Gower?

FLUELLEN  He is my dear friend, an please you.

KING HENRY  Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to
my tent.

FLUELLEN  I will fetch him.	[He exits.]

My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester,
Follow Fluellen closely at the heels.
The glove which I have given him for a favor
May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear.
It is the soldier's. I by bargain should
Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick.
If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
Some sudden mischief may arise of it,
For I do know Fluellen valiant
And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,
And quickly will return an injury.
Follow, and see there be no harm between them.--
Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.

[Enter Countess of Auvergne, with Porter.]

Porter, remember what I gave in charge,
And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.

PORTER  Madam, I will.	[He exits.]

The plot is laid. If all things fall out right,
I shall as famous be by this exploit
As Scythian Tamyris by Cyrus' death.
Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,
And his achievements of no less account.
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
To give their censure of these rare reports.

[Enter Messenger and Talbot.]

Madam, according as your Ladyship desired,
By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.

And he is welcome. What, is this the man?

Madam, it is.

COUNTESS  Is this the scourge of France?
Is this the Talbot, so much feared abroad
That with his name the mothers still their babes?
I see report is fabulous and false.
I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
Should strike such terror to his enemies.

Madam, I have been bold to trouble you.
But since your Ladyship is not at leisure,
I'll sort some other time to visit you.

COUNTESS, [to Messenger]
What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.

Stay, my Lord Talbot, for my lady craves
To know the cause of your abrupt departure.

Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,
I go to certify her Talbot's here.

[Enter Porter with keys.]

COUNTESS, [to Talbot]
If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.

Prisoner? To whom?

COUNTESS  To me, bloodthirsty lord.
And for that cause I trained thee to my house.
Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
For in my gallery thy picture hangs.
But now the substance shall endure the like,
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,
That hast by tyranny these many years
Wasted our country, slain our citizens,
And sent our sons and husbands captivate.

TALBOT  Ha, ha, ha!

Laughest thou, wretch? Thy mirth shall turn to moan.

I laugh to see your Ladyship so fond
To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow
Whereon to practice your severity.

COUNTESS  Why, art not thou the man?

TALBOT  I am, indeed.

COUNTESS  Then have I substance too.

No, no, I am but shadow of myself.
You are deceived; my substance is not here,
For what you see is but the smallest part
And least proportion of humanity.
I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
It is of such a spacious lofty pitch
Your roof were not sufficient to contain 't.

This is a riddling merchant for the nonce:
He will be here and yet he is not here.
How can these contrarieties agree?

That will I show you presently.
[Winds his horn. Drums strike up;
a peal of ordnance.]

[Enter Soldiers.]

How say you, madam? Are you now persuaded
That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,
With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,
And in a moment makes them desolate.

Victorious Talbot, pardon my abuse.
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,
And more than may be gathered by thy shape.
Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,
For I am sorry that with reverence
I did not entertain thee as thou art.

Be not dismayed, fair lady, nor misconster
The mind of Talbot as you did mistake
The outward composition of his body.
What you have done hath not offended me,
Nor other satisfaction do I crave
But only, with your patience, that we may
Taste of your wine and see what cates you have,
For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.

With all my heart, and think me honored
To feast so great a warrior in my house.

[Flourish. Enter King, Gloucester, Winchester, Talbot,
Exeter; York and Warwick, with white roses; Suffolk
and Somerset, with red roses; Governor of Paris,
and Others.]

Lord Bishop, set the crown upon his head.

WINCHESTER, [crowning King Henry]
God save King Henry, of that name the Sixth!

Now, Governor of Paris, take your oath.
[Governor kneels.]
That you elect no other king but him;
Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
And none your foes but such as shall pretend
Malicious practices against his state:
This shall you do, so help you righteous God.
[Governor rises.]

[Enter Fastolf.]

My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Callice
To haste unto your coronation,
A letter was delivered to my hands,
Writ to your Grace from th' Duke of Burgundy.
[He hands the King a paper.]

Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
I vowed, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
To tear the Garter from thy craven's leg,
[tearing it off]
Which I have done, because unworthily
Thou wast installed in that high degree.--
Pardon me, princely Henry and the rest.
This dastard, at the battle of Patay,
When but in all I was six thousand strong
And that the French were almost ten to one,
Before we met or that a stroke was given,
Like to a trusty squire did run away;
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men.
Myself and divers gentlemen besides
Were there surprised and taken prisoners.
Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss,
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
This ornament of knighthood--yea or no?

To say the truth, this fact was infamous
And ill beseeming any common man,
Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader.

When first this Order was ordained, my lords,
Knights of the Garter were of noble birth,
Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress,
But always resolute in most extremes.
He then that is not furnished in this sort
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
Profaning this most honorable Order,
And should, if I were worthy to be judge,
Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain
That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.

KING HENRY, [to Fastolf]
Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom.
Be packing therefore, thou that wast a knight.
Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.
[Fastolf exits.]
And now, my lord protector, view the letter
Sent from our uncle, Duke of Burgundy.
[He hands the paper to Gloucester.]

What means his Grace that he hath changed his style?
No more but, plain and bluntly, "To the King"!
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
Or doth this churlish superscription
Pretend some alteration in good will?
What's here? [(Reads.)]
I have upon especial cause,
Moved with compassion of my country's wrack,
Together with the pitiful complaints
Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
Forsaken your pernicious faction
And joined with Charles, the rightful king of France.
O monstrous treachery! Can this be so?
That in alliance, amity, and oaths
There should be found such false dissembling guile?

What? Doth my Uncle Burgundy revolt?

He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.

Is that the worst this letter doth contain?

It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.

Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him
And give him chastisement for this abuse.--
How say you, my lord, are you not content?

Content, my liege? Yes. But that I am prevented,
I should have begged I might have been employed.

Then gather strength and march unto him straight;
Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
And what offense it is to flout his friends.

I go, my lord, in heart desiring still
You may behold confusion of your foes.	[He exits.]

[Enter Vernon, with a white rose, and Basset,
with a red rose.]

Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.

And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.

YORK, [indicating Vernon]
This is my servant; hear him, noble prince.

SOMERSET, [indicating Basset]
And this is mine, sweet Henry; favor him.

Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak.--
Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim,
And wherefore crave you combat, or with whom?

With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong.

And I with him, for he hath done me wrong.

What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
First let me know, and then I'll answer you.

Crossing the sea from England into France,
This fellow here with envious carping tongue
Upbraided me about the rose I wear,
Saying the sanguine color of the leaves
Did represent my master's blushing cheeks
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
About a certain question in the law
Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him,
With other vile and ignominious terms.
In confutation of which rude reproach,
And in defense of my lord's worthiness,
I crave the benefit of law of arms.

And that is my petition, noble lord;
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
To set a gloss upon his bold intent,
Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him,
And he first took exceptions at this badge,
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
Bewrayed the faintness of my master's heart.

Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?

Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,
Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.

Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men
When for so slight and frivolous a cause
Such factious emulations shall arise!
Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,
Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.

Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
And then your Highness shall command a peace.

The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;
Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.

YORK, [throwing down a gage]
There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.

VERNON, [to Somerset]
Nay, let it rest where it began at first.

BASSET, [to Somerset]
Confirm it so, mine honorable lord.

Confirm it so? Confounded be your strife,
And perish you with your audacious prate!
Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed
With this immodest clamorous outrage
To trouble and disturb the King and us?--
And you, my lords, methinks you do not well
To bear with their perverse objections,
Much less to take occasion from their mouths
To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves.
Let me persuade you take a better course.

It grieves his Highness. Good my lords, be friends.

Come hither, you that would be combatants:
Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favor,
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.--
And you, my lords, remember where we are:
In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation.
If they perceive dissension in our looks,
And that within ourselves we disagree,
How will their grudging stomachs be provoked
To willful disobedience and rebel!
Besides, what infamy will there arise
When foreign princes shall be certified
That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
King Henry's peers and chief nobility
Destroyed themselves and lost the realm of France!
O, think upon the conquest of my father,
My tender years, and let us not forgo
That for a trifle that was bought with blood.
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
I see no reason if I wear this rose
That anyone should therefore be suspicious
I more incline to Somerset than York.
[He puts on a red rose.]
Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
As well they may upbraid me with my crown
Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crowned.
But your discretions better can persuade
Than I am able to instruct or teach;
And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
So let us still continue peace and love.
Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
To be our regent in these parts of France;--
And good my Lord of Somerset, unite
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
Go cheerfully together and digest
Your angry choler on your enemies.
Ourself, my lord protector, and the rest,
After some respite, will return to Callice;
From thence to England, where I hope ere long
To be presented, by your victories,
With Charles, Alanson, and that traitorous rout.
[Flourish. All but York, Warwick, Exeter, Vernon exit.]

My Lord of York, I promise you the King
Prettily, methought, did play the orator.

And so he did, but yet I like it not
In that he wears the badge of Somerset.

Tush, that was but his fancy; blame him not.
I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.

And if iwis he did--but let it rest.
Other affairs must now be managed.

[York, Warwick and Vernon exit.
Exeter remains.]

Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice,
For had the passions of thy heart burst out,
I fear we should have seen deciphered there
More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,
Than yet can be imagined or supposed.
But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees
This jarring discord of nobility,
This shouldering of each other in the court,
This factious bandying of their favorites,
But sees it doth presage some ill event.
'Tis much when scepters are in children's hands,
But more when envy breeds unkind division:
There comes the ruin; there begins confusion.

[Enter Somerset with his army and a Captain
from Talbot's army.]

It is too late; I cannot send them now.
This expedition was by York and Talbot
Too rashly plotted. All our general force
Might with a sally of the very town
Be buckled with. The overdaring Talbot
Hath sullied all his gloss of former honor
By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure.
York set him on to fight and die in shame
That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.


Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me
Set from our o'er-matched forces forth for aid.

How now, Sir William, whither were you sent?

Whither, my lord? From bought and sold Lord Talbot,
Who, ringed about with bold adversity,
Cries out for noble York and Somerset
To beat assailing Death from his weak regions;
And whiles the honorable captain there
Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs
And, in advantage ling'ring, looks for rescue,
You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honor,
Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.
Let not your private discord keep away
The levied succors that should lend him aid,
While he, renowned noble gentleman,
Yield up his life unto a world of odds.
Orleance the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,
Alanson, Reignier compass him about,
And Talbot perisheth by your default.

York set him on; York should have sent him aid.

And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims,
Swearing that you withhold his levied host
Collected for this expedition.

York lies. He might have sent and had the horse.
I owe him little duty and less love,
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.

The fraud of England, not the force of France,
Hath now entrapped the noble-minded Talbot.
Never to England shall he bear his life,
But dies betrayed to fortune by your strife.

Come, go. I will dispatch the horsemen straight.
Within six hours they will be at his aid.

Too late comes rescue; he is ta'en or slain,
For fly he could not if he would have fled;
And fly would Talbot never, though he might.

If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu.

His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.

[Sound trumpets. Enter King Henry and State
(Queen Margaret, Gloucester, York, Salisbury, Suffolk,
and Others) with Guard, to banish the Duchess of
Gloucester, who is accompanied by Margery Jourdain,
Southwell, Hume, and Bolingbroke, all guarded.]

Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's
In sight of God and us, your guilt is great.
Receive the sentence of the law for sins
Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.
[To Jourdain, Southwell, Hume, and Bolingbroke.]
You four, from hence to prison back again;
From thence unto the place of execution:
The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes,
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
[To Duchess] You, madam, for you are more nobly
born,
Despoiled of your honor in your life,
Shall, after three days' open penance done,
Live in your country here in banishment
With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man.

Welcome is banishment. Welcome were my death.

Eleanor, the law, thou seest, hath judged thee.
I cannot justify whom the law condemns.
[Duchess and the other prisoners exit under guard.]
Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.
Ah, Humphrey, this dishonor in thine age
Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground.--
I beseech your Majesty give me leave to go;
Sorrow would solace, and mine age would ease.

Stay, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Ere thou go,
Give up thy staff. Henry will to himself
Protector be; and God shall be my hope,
My stay, my guide, and lantern to my feet.
And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved
Than when thou wert Protector to thy king.

I see no reason why a king of years
Should be to be protected like a child.
God and King Henry govern England's realm!--
Give up your staff, sir, and the King his realm.

My staff?--Here, noble Henry, is my staff.
[He puts down his staff before Henry.]
As willingly do I the same resign
As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
As others would ambitiously receive it.
Farewell, good king. When I am dead and gone,
May honorable peace attend thy throne.
[Henry picks up the staff.]

Why, now is Henry king and Margaret queen,
And Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, scarce himself,
That bears so shrewd a maim. Two pulls at once:
His lady banished and a limb lopped off.
This staff of honor raught, there let it stand
Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.

Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;
Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.

Lords, let him go.--Please it your Majesty,
This is the day appointed for the combat,
And ready are the appellant and defendant--
The armorer and his man--to enter the lists,
So please your Highness to behold the fight.

Ay, good my lord, for purposely therefor
Left I the court to see this quarrel tried.

I' God's name, see the lists and all things fit.
Here let them end it, and God defend the right!

I never saw a fellow worse bestead
Or more afraid to fight than is the appellant,
The servant of this armorer, my lords.

[Enter at one door the Armorer Horner and his
Neighbors, drinking to him so much that he is drunk;
and he enters with a Drum before him and his staff with
a sandbag fastened to it; and at the other door his man
Peter, with a Drum and sandbag, and Prentices
drinking to him.]

FIRST NEIGHBOR  Here, neighbor Horner, I drink to you
in a cup of sack; and fear not, neighbor, you shall
do well enough.

SECOND NEIGHBOR  And here, neighbor, here's a cup of
charneco.

THIRD NEIGHBOR  And here's a pot of good double beer,
neighbor. Drink, and fear not your man.

HORNER  Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all.
And a fig for Peter!	[They drink.]

FIRST PRENTICE  Here, Peter, I drink to thee, and be not
afraid.

SECOND PRENTICE  Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy
master. Fight for credit of the prentices.

PETER  I thank you all. Drink, and pray for me, I pray
you, for I think I have taken my last draft in this
world. Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee my
apron.--And, Will, thou shalt have my hammer.--
And here, Tom, take all the money that I have. [He
distributes his possessions.] O Lord, bless me, I
pray God, for I am never able to deal with my
master. He hath learnt so much fence already.

SALISBURY  Come, leave your drinking, and fall to
blows. Sirrah, what's thy name?

PETER  Peter, forsooth.

SALISBURY  Peter? What more?

PETER  Thump.

SALISBURY  Thump? Then see thou thump thy master

HORNER  Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon
my man's instigation, to prove him a knave and
myself an honest man; and touching the Duke of
York, I will take my death I never meant him any
ill, nor the King, nor the Queen.--And therefore,
Peter, have at thee with a downright blow!

YORK  Dispatch. This knave's tongue begins to double.
Sound, trumpets. Alarum to the combatants!
[They fight, and Peter strikes him down.]

HORNER  Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.

YORK  Take away his weapon.--Fellow, thank God and
the good wine in thy master's way.

PETER  O God, have I overcome mine enemies in this
presence? O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!

Go, take hence that traitor from our sight;
For by his death we do perceive his guilt.
And God in justice hath revealed to us
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
Which he had thought to have murdered
wrongfully.--
Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.
[Sound a flourish. They exit, bearing Horner's body.]

[Enter Bevis and John Holland with staves.]

BEVIS  Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a
lath. They have been up these two days.

HOLLAND  They have the more need to sleep now, then.

BEVIS  I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress
the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap
upon it.

HOLLAND  So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I
say, it was never merry world in England since
gentlemen came up.

BEVIS  O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in
handicraftsmen.

HOLLAND  The nobility think scorn to go in leather
aprons.

BEVIS  Nay, more, the King's Council are no good
workmen.

HOLLAND  True, and yet it is said "Labor in thy vocation,"
which is as much to say as "Let the magistrates
be laboring men." And therefore should we
be magistrates.

BEVIS  Thou hast hit it, for there's no better sign of a
brave mind than a hard hand.

HOLLAND  I see them, I see them! There's Best's son, the
tanner of Wingham--

BEVIS  He shall have the skins of our enemies to make
dog's leather of.

HOLLAND  And Dick the butcher--

BEVIS  Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's
throat cut like a calf.

HOLLAND  And Smith the weaver.

BEVIS  Argo, their thread of life is spun.

HOLLAND  Come, come, let's fall in with them.

[Drum. Enter Cade, Dick the butcher, Smith the
weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers,
all with staves.]

CADE  We, John Cade, so termed of our supposed
father--

DICK, [aside]  Or rather of stealing a cade of herrings.

CADE  For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired
with the spirit of putting down kings and princes--
command silence.

DICK  Silence!

CADE  My father was a Mortimer--

DICK, [aside]  He was an honest man and a good
bricklayer.

CADE  My mother a Plantagenet--

DICK, [aside]  I knew her well; she was a midwife.

CADE  My wife descended of the Lacys.

DICK, [aside]  She was indeed a peddler's daughter, and
sold many laces.

SMITH, [aside]  But now of late, not able to travel with
her furred pack, she washes bucks here at home.

CADE  Therefore am I of an honorable house.

DICK, [aside]  Ay, by my faith, the field is honorable;
and there was he born, under a hedge, for his
father had never a house but the cage.

CADE  Valiant I am--

SMITH, [aside]  He must needs, for beggary is valiant.

CADE  I am able to endure much--

DICK, [aside]  No question of that; for I have seen him
whipped three market-days together.

CADE  I fear neither sword nor fire.

SMITH, [aside]  He need not fear the sword, for his coat
is of proof.

DICK, [aside]  But methinks he should stand in fear of
fire, being burnt i' th' hand for stealing of sheep.

CADE  Be brave, then, for your captain is brave and
vows reformation. There shall be in England seven
halfpenny loaves sold for a penny. The three-hooped
pot shall have ten hoops, and I will make it
felony to drink small beer. All the realm shall be in
common, and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to
grass. And when I am king, as king I will be--

ALL  God save your Majesty!

CADE  I thank you, good people.--There shall be no
money; all shall eat and drink on my score; and I
will apparel them all in one livery, that they may
agree like brothers and worship me their lord.

DICK  The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.

CADE  Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable
thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should
be made parchment? That parchment, being scribbled
o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee
stings, but I say, 'tis the beeswax; for I did but seal
once to a thing, and I was never mine own man
since. How now? Who's there?

[Enter a Clerk of Chartham, under guard.]

SMITH  The clerk of Chartham. He can write and read
and cast account.

CADE  O, monstrous!

SMITH  We took him setting of boys' copies.

CADE  Here's a villain!

SMITH  H'as a book in his pocket with red letters in 't.

CADE  Nay, then, he is a conjurer.

DICK  Nay, he can make obligations and write court

CADE  I am sorry for 't. The man is a proper man, of
mine honor. Unless I find him guilty, he shall not
die.--Come hither, sirrah; I must examine thee.
What is thy name?

CLERK  Emmanuel.

DICK  They use to write it on the top of letters.--'Twill
go hard with you.

CADE  Let me alone.--Dost thou use to write thy
name? Or hast thou a mark to thyself, like an
honest, plain-dealing man?

CLERK  Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought
up that I can write my name.

ALL  He hath confessed. Away with him! He's a villain
and a traitor.

CADE  Away with him, I say! Hang him with his pen
and inkhorn about his neck.
[One exits with the Clerk.]

[Enter Michael.]

MICHAEL  Where's our general?

CADE  Here I am, thou particular fellow.

MICHAEL  Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his
brother are hard by, with the King's forces.

CADE  Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down. He
shall be encountered with a man as good as himself.
He is but a knight, is he?

MICHAEL  No.

CADE  To equal him I will make myself a knight
presently. [He kneels.] Rise up Sir John Mortimer.
[He rises.] Now have at him!

[Enter Sir Humphrey Stafford and his Brother, with
a Herald, Drum, and Soldiers.]

STAFFORD
Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
Marked for the gallows, lay your weapons down!
Home to your cottages; forsake this groom.
The King is merciful, if you revolt.

BROTHER
But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,
If you go forward. Therefore yield, or die.

CADE
As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not.
It is to you, good people, that I speak,
Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign,
For I am rightful heir unto the crown.

STAFFORD
Villain, thy father was a plasterer,
And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?

CADE
And Adam was a gardener.

BROTHER  And what of that?

CADE
Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March,
Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?

STAFFORD  Ay, sir.

CADE
By her he had two children at one birth.

BROTHER  That's false.

CADE
Ay, there's the question. But I say 'tis true.
The elder of them, being put to nurse,
Was by a beggar-woman stol'n away,
And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,
Became a bricklayer when he came to age.
His son am I. Deny it if you can.

DICK
Nay, 'tis too true. Therefore he shall be king.

SMITH  Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house,
and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it.
Therefore deny it not.

STAFFORD
And will you credit this base drudge's words,
That speaks he knows not what?

Ay, marry, will we. Therefore get you gone.

BROTHER
Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.

CADE  He lies, [aside] for I invented it myself.--Go to,
sirrah. Tell the King from me that, for his father's
sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys went to
span-counter for French crowns, I am content he
shall reign, but I'll be Protector over him.

DICK  And, furthermore, we'll have the Lord Saye's
head for selling the dukedom of Maine.

CADE  And good reason: for thereby is England mained
and fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance
holds it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord
Saye hath gelded the commonwealth and made it
an eunuch; and, more than that, he can speak
French, and therefore he is a traitor.

STAFFORD
O, gross and miserable ignorance!

CADE  Nay, answer if you can. The Frenchmen are our
enemies. Go to, then, I ask but this: can he that
speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good
counselor, or no?

ALL  No, no, and therefore we'll have his head!

BROTHER, [to Stafford]
Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,
Assail them with the army of the King.

STAFFORD
Herald, away, and throughout every town
Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade,
That those which fly before the battle ends
May, even in their wives' and children's sight
Be hanged up for example at their doors.--
And you that be the King's friends, follow me.
[The Staffords, Soldiers, and Herald exit.]

CADE
And you that love the Commons, follow me.
Now show yourselves men. 'Tis for liberty!
We will not leave one lord, one gentleman;
Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon,
For they are thrifty, honest men and such
As would, but that they dare not, take our parts.

DICK  They are all in order and march toward us.

CADE  But then are we in order when we are most out
of order. Come, march forward.

[Alarums. Matthew Gough is slain, and all the rest.
Then enter Jack Cade with his company.]

CADE  So, sirs. Now go some and pull down the Savoy;
others to th' Inns of Court. Down with them all!

DICK  I have a suit unto your Lordship.

CADE  Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.

DICK  Only that the laws of England may come out of
your mouth.

HOLLAND, [aside]  Mass, 'twill be sore law, then, for he
was thrust in the mouth with a spear, and 'tis not
whole yet.

SMITH, [aside]  Nay, John, it will be stinking law, for
his breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.

CADE  I have thought upon it; it shall be so. Away!
Burn all the records of the realm. My mouth shall
be the Parliament of England.

HOLLAND, [aside]  Then we are like to have biting
statutes--unless his teeth be pulled out.

CADE  And henceforward all things shall be in
common.


MESSENGER  My lord, a prize, a prize! Here's the Lord
Saye, which sold the towns in France, he that
made us pay one-and-twenty fifteens, and one
shilling to the pound, the last subsidy.

[Enter George with the Lord Saye.]

CADE  Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times.--Ah,
thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord, now
art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction
regal. What canst thou answer to my Majesty for
giving up of Normandy unto Monsieur Basimecu,
the Dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by
these presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer,
that I am the besom that must sweep the
court clean of such filth as thou art. Thou hast
most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm
in erecting a grammar school; and whereas,
before, our forefathers had no other books but the
score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be
used, and, contrary to the King his crown and dignity,
thou hast built a paper mill. It will be proved
to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually
talk of a noun and a verb and such abominable
words as no Christian ear can endure to hear.
Thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor
men before them about matters they were not able
to answer. Moreover, thou hast put them in prison;
and, because they could not read, thou hast
hanged them, when indeed only for that cause
they have been most worthy to live. Thou dost ride
on a footcloth, dost thou not?

SAYE  What of that?

CADE  Marry, thou oughtst not to let thy horse wear a
cloak when honester men than thou go in their
hose and doublets.

DICK  And work in their shirt too--as myself, for example,
that am a butcher.

SAYE  You men of Kent--

DICK  What say you of Kent?

SAYE  Nothing but this: 'tis bona terra, mala gens.

CADE  Away with him, away with him! He speaks
Latin.

Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.
Kent, in the commentaries Caesar writ,
Is termed the civil'st place of all this isle.
Sweet is the country, because full of riches;
The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.
I sold not Maine; I lost not Normandy;
Yet to recover them would lose my life.
Justice with favor have I always done;
Prayers and tears have moved me; gifts could never.
When have I aught exacted at your hands
Kent to maintain, the King, the realm, and you?
Large gifts have I bestowed on learned clerks,
Because my book preferred me to the King.
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,
Unless you be possessed with devilish spirits,
You cannot but forbear to murder me.
This tongue hath parleyed unto foreign kings
For your behoof--

CADE  Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?

Great men have reaching hands. Oft have I struck
Those that I never saw, and struck them dead.

GEORGE  O monstrous coward! What, to come behind
folks?

These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.

CADE  Give him a box o' th' ear, and that will make 'em
red again.

Long sitting to determine poor men's causes
Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.

CADE  You shall have a hempen caudle, then, and
the help of hatchet.

DICK  Why dost thou quiver, man?

SAYE  The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.

CADE  Nay, he nods at us, as who should say "I'll be
even with you." I'll see if his head will stand steadier
on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead

Tell me, wherein have I offended most?
Have I affected wealth or honor? Speak.
Are my chests filled up with extorted gold?
Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?
Whom have I injured, that you seek my death?
These hands are free from guiltless blood-shedding,
This breast from harboring foul deceitful thoughts.
O, let me live!

CADE  I feel remorse in myself with his words, but I'll
bridle it. He shall die, an it be but for pleading so
well for his life. Away with him! He has a familiar
under his tongue; he speaks not i' God's name. Go,
take him away, I say, and strike off his head
presently; and then break into his son-in-law's
house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off his head;
and bring them both upon two poles hither.

ALL  It shall be done.

Ah, countrymen, if when you make your prayers,
God should be so obdurate as yourselves,
How would it fare with your departed souls?
And therefore yet relent, and save my life.

CADE  Away with him, and do as I command you.
[Some exit with Lord Saye.]
The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a
head on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute.
There shall not a maid be married but she shall
pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it. Men
shall hold of me in capite; and we charge and command
that their wives be as free as heart can wish
or tongue can tell.

DICK  My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside and take
up commodities upon our bills?

CADE  Marry, presently.

ALL  O, brave!

[Enter one with the heads of Lord Saye and Sir James
Cromer on poles.]

CADE  But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,
for they loved well when they were alive. [The
heads are brought together.] Now part them again,
lest they consult about the giving up of some more
towns in France. Soldiers, defer the spoil of the
city until night, for, with these borne before us
instead of maces, will we ride through the streets
and at every corner have them kiss. Away!
[He exits with his company.]

[A march. Enter Edward, Richard, and their power,

I wonder how our princely father scaped,
Or whether he be scaped away or no
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit.
Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
Or had he scaped, methinks we should have heard
The happy tidings of his good escape.
How fares my brother? Why is he so sad?

I cannot joy until I be resolved
Where our right valiant father is become.
I saw him in the battle range about
And watched him how he singled Clifford forth.
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
As doth a lion in a herd of neat,
Or as a bear encompassed round with dogs,
Who having pinched a few and made them cry,
The rest stand all aloof and bark at him;
So fared our father with his enemies;
So fled his enemies my warlike father.
Methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son.
See how the morning opes her golden gates
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun.
How well resembles it the prime of youth,
Trimmed like a younker, prancing to his love!

Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,
Not separated with the racking clouds
But severed in a pale clear-shining sky.
See, see, they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
As if they vowed some league inviolable.
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun;
In this, the heaven figures some event.

'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
Each one already blazing by our meeds,
Should notwithstanding join our lights together
And overshine the earth, as this the world.
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
Upon my target three fair shining suns.

Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
You love the breeder better than the male.

[Enter a Messenger, blowing.]

But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?

Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on
Whenas the noble Duke of York was slain,
Your princely father and my loving lord.

O, speak no more, for I have heard too much!

Say how he died, for I will hear it all.

Environed he was with many foes,
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
Against the Greeks that would have entered Troy.
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
And many strokes, though with a little axe,
Hews down and fells the hardest-timbered oak.
By many hands your father was subdued,
But only slaughtered by the ireful arm
Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen,
Who crowned the gracious duke in high despite,
Laughed in his face; and when with grief he wept,
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain.
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
They took his head and on the gates of York
They set the same, and there it doth remain,
The saddest spectacle that e'er I viewed.	[He exits.]

Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, boist'rous Clifford, thou hast slain
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
And treacherously hast thou vanquished him,
For hand to hand he would have vanquished thee.
Now my soul's palace is become a prison;
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest,
For never henceforth shall I joy again.
Never, O never, shall I see more joy!	[He weeps.]

I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart;
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden,
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast
And burns me up with flames that tears would
quench.
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
Tears, then, for babes; blows and revenge for me.
Richard, I bear thy name. I'll venge thy death
Or die renowned by attempting it.

His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
His dukedom and his chair with me is left.

Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun;
For "chair" and "dukedom," "throne" and
"kingdom" say;
Either that is thine or else thou wert not his.

[March. Enter Warwick, Marquess Montague, and their
army, all wearing the white rose.]

How now, fair lords? What fare, what news abroad?

Great lord of Warwick, if we should recount
Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain.

O Warwick, Warwick, that Plantagenet
Which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.

Ten days ago I drowned these news in tears.
And now to add more measure to your woes,
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
I, then in London, keeper of the King,
Mustered my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,
Marched toward Saint Albans to intercept the
Bearing the King in my behalf along;
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree in Parliament
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
Short tale to make, we at Saint Albans met,
Our battles joined, and both sides fiercely fought.
But whether 'twas the coldness of the King,
Who looked full gently on his warlike queen,
That robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen,
Or whether 'twas report of her success
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigor,
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
I cannot judge; but to conclude with truth,
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Our soldiers', like the night owl's lazy flight
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
I cheered them up with justice of our cause,
With promise of high pay and great rewards,
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
And we, in them, no hope to win the day,
So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;
Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself
In haste, posthaste, are come to join with you;
For in the Marches here we heard you were,
Making another head to fight again.

Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
And when came George from Burgundy to England?

Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers,
And, for your brother, he was lately sent
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.

'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.

Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear?
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head
And wring the awful scepter from his fist,
Were he as famous and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.

I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.
'Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak.
But in this troublous time, what's to be done?
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Numb'ring our Ave Marys with our beads?
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
If for the last, say "Ay," and to it, lords.

Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords: the proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland
And of their feather many more proud birds,
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
He swore consent to your succession,
His oath enrolled in the Parliament.
And now to London all the crew are gone
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
May make against the house of Lancaster.
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
Why, via, to London will we march,
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
And once again cry "Charge!" upon our foes,
But never once again turn back and fly.

Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day
That cries "Retire!" if Warwick bid him stay.

Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend.

No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
The next degree is England's royal throne:
For King of England shalt thou be proclaimed
In every borough as we pass along,
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
Stay we no longer dreaming of renown,
But sound the trumpets and about our task.

Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
I come to pierce it or to give thee mine.

Then strike up drums! God and Saint George for us!


WARWICK  How now, what news?

The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,
The Queen is coming with a puissant host,
And craves your company for speedy counsel.

Why, then it sorts. Brave warriors, let's away!

[Flourish. Enter King Henry, Queen Margaret,
Clifford, Northumberland, and young Prince Edward,
all wearing the red rose with Drum and Trumpets,
the head of York fixed above them.]

QUEEN MARGARET, [to King Henry]
Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
That sought to be encompassed with your crown.
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?

Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack!
To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'Tis not my fault,
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.

My gracious liege, this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Ambitious York did level at thy crown,
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows.
He, but a duke, would have his son a king
And raise his issue like a loving sire;
Thou being a king, blest with a goodly son,
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet in protection of their tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
Make war with him that climbed unto their nest,
Offering their own lives in their young's defense?
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent.
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
And long hereafter say unto his child
"What my great-grandfather and grandsire got,
My careless father fondly gave away"?
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy,
And let his manly face, which promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.

Full well hath Clifford played the orator,
Inferring arguments of mighty force.
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
That things ill got had ever bad success?
And happy always was it for that son
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind,
And would my father had left me no more;
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thousandfold more care to keep
Than in possession any jot of pleasure.
Ah, cousin York, would thy best friends did know
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here.

My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
You promised knighthood to our forward son.
Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently.--
Edward, kneel down.	[He kneels.]

KING HENRY, [dubbing him knight]
Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight,
And learn this lesson: draw thy sword in right.

PRINCE EDWARD, [rising]
My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown
And in that quarrel use it to the death.

Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.


Royal commanders, be in readiness,
For with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York,
And in the towns as they do march along
Proclaims him king, and many fly to him.
Deraign your battle, for they are at hand.	[He exits.]

I would your Highness would depart the field.
The Queen hath best success when you are absent.

Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.

Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.

Be it with resolution, then, to fight.

My royal father, cheer these noble lords
And hearten those that fight in your defense.
Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry "Saint
George!"

[March. Enter Edward, Warwick, Richard,
George, Norfolk, Montague, and Soldiers,

Now, perjured Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace
And set thy diadem upon my head,
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?

Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?

I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
I was adopted heir by his consent.
Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
You that are king, though he do wear the crown,
Have caused him, by new act of Parliament,
To blot out me and put his own son in.

CLIFFORD  And reason too:
Who should succeed the father but the son?

Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!

Ay, crookback, here I stand to answer thee,
Or any he, the proudest of thy sort.

'Twas you that killed young Rutland, was it not?

Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.

For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight!

What sayst thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?

Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick, dare you
When you and I met at Saint Albans last,
Your legs did better service than your hands.

Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.

You said so much before, and yet you fled.

'Twas not your valor, Clifford, drove me thence.

No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.

Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.--
Break off the parley, for scarce I can refrain
The execution of my big-swoll'n heart
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.

I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?

Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland.
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.

Have done with words, my lords, and hear me

Defy them, then, or else hold close thy lips.

I prithee, give no limits to my tongue.
I am a king and privileged to speak.

My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Cannot be cured by words; therefore, be still.

Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
By Him that made us all, I am resolved
That Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.

Say, Henry, shall I have my right or no?
A thousand men have broke their fasts today
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.

If thou deny, their blood upon thy head,
For York in justice puts his armor on.

If that be right which Warwick says is right,
There is no wrong, but everything is right.

Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands,
For well I wot thou hast thy mother's tongue.

But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam,
But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,
Marked by the Destinies to be avoided,
As venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings.

Iron of Naples, hid with English gilt,
Whose father bears the title of a king,
As if a channel should be called the sea,
Sham'st thou not, knowing whence thou art
extraught,
To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart?

A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
To make this shameless callet know herself.--
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wronged
By that false woman as this king by thee.
His father reveled in the heart of France,
And tamed the King, and made the Dauphin stoop;
And had he matched according to his state,
He might have kept that glory to this day.
But when he took a beggar to his bed
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal day,
Even then that sunshine brewed a shower for him
That washed his father's fortunes forth of France
And heaped sedition on his crown at home.
For what hath broached this tumult but thy pride?
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept,
And we, in pity of the gentle king,
Had slipped our claim until another age.

But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
We set the axe to thy usurping root;
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike,
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.

And in this resolution, I defy thee,
Not willing any longer conference,
Since thou denied'st the gentle king to speak.--
Sound, trumpets! Let our bloody colors wave;
And either victory or else a grave!

QUEEN MARGARET  Stay, Edward!

No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay.
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.

[Enter two Gentlemen at several doors.]

Whither away so fast?

SECOND GENTLEMAN  O, God save you.
E'en to the Hall to hear what shall become
Of the great Duke of Buckingham.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  I'll save you
That labor, sir. All's now done but the ceremony
Of bringing back the prisoner.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  Were you there?

Yes, indeed was I.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  Pray speak what has happened.

You may guess quickly what.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  Is he found guilty?

Yes, truly, is he, and condemned upon 't.

I am sorry for 't.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  So are a number more.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  But pray, how passed it?

I'll tell you in a little. The great duke
Came to the bar, where to his accusations
He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
The King's attorney on the contrary
Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions
Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desired
To him brought viva voce to his face;
At which appeared against him his surveyor,
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,
Confessor to him, with that devil monk,
Hopkins, that made this mischief.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  That was he
That fed him with his prophecies?

FIRST GENTLEMAN  The same.
All these accused him strongly, which he fain
Would have flung from him, but indeed he could not.
And so his peers upon this evidence
Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
He spoke, and learnedly, for life, but all
Was either pitied in him or forgotten.

After all this, how did he bear himself?

When he was brought again to th' bar to hear
His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirred
With such an agony he sweat extremely
And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty.
But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
In all the rest showed a most noble patience.

I do not think he fears death.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  Sure he does not;
He never was so womanish. The cause
He may a little grieve at.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  Certainly
The Cardinal is the end of this.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  'Tis likely,
By all conjectures; first, Kildare's attainder,
Then Deputy of Ireland, who, removed,
Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,
Lest he should help his father.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  That trick of state
Was a deep envious one.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  At his return
No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,
And generally: whoever the King favors,
The Card'nal instantly will find employment,
And far enough from court too.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  All the commons
Hate him perniciously and, o' my conscience,
Wish him ten fathom deep. This duke as much
They love and dote on, call him bounteous
Buckingham,
The mirror of all courtesy.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  Stay there, sir,
And see the noble ruined man you speak of.

[Enter Buckingham from his arraignment, Tipstaves before
him, the ax with the edge towards him, Halberds on each
side, accompanied with Sir Thomas Lovell, Sir Nicholas
Vaux, Sir Walter Sands, and Common People, etc.]

Let's stand close and behold him.

BUCKINGHAM  All good people,
You that thus far have come to pity me,
Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.
I have this day received a traitor's judgment,
And by that name must die. Yet heaven bear witness,
And if I have a conscience, let it sink me
Even as the ax falls, if I be not faithful!
The law I bear no malice for my death;
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice.
But those that sought it I could wish more Christian.
Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em.
Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,
For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.
For further life in this world I ne'er hope,
Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies
More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
Is only bitter to him, only dying,
Go with me like good angels to my end,
And as the long divorce of steel falls on me,
Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,
And lift my soul to heaven.--Lead on, a' God's name.

I do beseech your Grace, for charity,
If ever any malice in your heart
Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.

Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
As I would be forgiven. I forgive all.
There cannot be those numberless offenses
'Gainst me that I cannot take peace with. No black
envy
Shall make my grave. Commend me to his Grace.
And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him
You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers
Yet are the King's and, till my soul forsake,
Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live
Longer than I have time to tell his years.
Ever beloved and loving may his rule be;
And when old Time shall lead him to his end,
Goodness and he fill up one monument!

To th' waterside I must conduct your Grace,
Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,
Who undertakes you to your end.

VAUX, [calling as to Officers offstage]  Prepare there!
The Duke is coming. See the barge be ready,
And fit it with such furniture as suits
The greatness of his person.

BUCKINGHAM  Nay, Sir Nicholas,
Let it alone. My state now will but mock me.
When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable
And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it,
And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for 't.
My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
Who first raised head against usurping Richard,
Flying for succor to his servant Banister,
Being distressed, was by that wretch betrayed,
And, without trial, fell. God's peace be with him.
Henry the Seventh, succeeding, truly pitying
My father's loss, like a most royal prince
Restored me to my honors and out of ruins
Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
Henry the Eighth, life, honor, name, and all
That made me happy at one stroke has taken
Forever from the world. I had my trial,
And must needs say a noble one, which makes me
A little happier than my wretched father.
Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most--
A most unnatural and faithless service.
Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me,
This from a dying man receive as certain:
Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
Like water from you, never found again
But where they mean to sink you. All good people,
Pray for me. I must now forsake you. The last hour
Of my long weary life is come upon me.
Farewell. And when you would say something that
is sad,
Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me.
[Duke and train exit.]

O, this is full of pity, sir! It calls,
I fear, too many curses on their heads
That were the authors.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  If the Duke be guiltless,
'Tis full of woe. Yet I can give you inkling
Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,
Greater than this.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  Good angels keep it from us!
What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?

This secret is so weighty 'twill require
A strong faith to conceal it.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  Let me have it.
I do not talk much.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  I am confident;
You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear
A buzzing of a separation
Between the King and Katherine?

FIRST GENTLEMAN  Yes, but it held not;
For when the King once heard it, out of anger
He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
To stop the rumor and allay those tongues
That durst disperse it.

SECOND GENTLEMAN  But that slander, sir,
Is found a truth now, for it grows again
Fresher than e'er it was, and held for certain
The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal,
Or some about him near, have, out of malice
To the good queen, possessed him with a scruple
That will undo her. To confirm this too,
Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately,
As all think, for this business.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  'Tis the Cardinal;
And merely to revenge him on the Emperor
For not bestowing on him at his asking
The archbishopric of Toledo this is purposed.

I think you have hit the mark. But is 't not cruel
That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal
Will have his will, and she must fall.

FIRST GENTLEMAN  'Tis woeful.
We are too open here to argue this.
Let's think in private more.

[Enter Katherine Dowager, sick, led between Griffith, her
gentleman usher, and Patience, her woman.]

GRIFFITH
How does your Grace?

KATHERINE  O Griffith, sick to death.
My legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth,
Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair.
So. Now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou ledst me,
That the great child of honor, Cardinal Wolsey,
Was dead?

GRIFFITH  Yes, madam, but I think your Grace,
Out of the pain you suffered, gave no ear to 't.

Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.
If well, he stepped before me happily
For my example.

GRIFFITH  Well, the voice goes, madam;
For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Arrested him at York and brought him forward,
As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
He could not sit his mule.

KATHERINE  Alas, poor man!

GRIFFITH
At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,
Lodged in the abbey, where the reverend abbot
With all his convent honorably received him;
To whom he gave these words: "O Father Abbot,
An old man, broken with the storms of state,
Is come to lay his weary bones among you.
Give him a little earth, for charity."
So went to bed, where eagerly his sickness
Pursued him still; and three nights after this,
About the hour of eight, which he himself
Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,
Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
He gave his honors to the world again,
His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.

So may he rest. His faults lie gently on him!
Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
And yet with charity. He was a man
Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
Himself with princes; one that by suggestion
Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair play.
His own opinion was his law. I' th' presence
He would say untruths, and be ever double
Both in his words and meaning. He was never,
But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.
His promises were, as he then was, mighty,
But his performance, as he is now, nothing.
Of his own body he was ill, and gave
The clergy ill example.

GRIFFITH  Noble madam,
Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues
We write in water. May it please your Highness
To hear me speak his good now?

KATHERINE  Yes, good Griffith;
I were malicious else.

GRIFFITH  This cardinal,
Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly
Was fashioned to much honor. From his cradle
He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one:
Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not,
But, to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.
And though he were unsatisfied in getting,
Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,
He was most princely. Ever witness for him
Those twins of learning that he raised in you,
Ipswich and Oxford, one of which fell with him,
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
The other, though unfinished, yet so famous,
So excellent in art, and still so rising,
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
His overthrow heaped happiness upon him,
For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
And found the blessedness of being little.
And, to add greater honors to his age
Than man could give him, he died fearing God.

After my death I wish no other herald,
No other speaker of my living actions,
To keep mine honor from corruption
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,
With thy religious truth and modesty,
Now in his ashes honor. Peace be with him!--
Patience, be near me still, and set me lower.
I have not long to trouble thee.--Good Griffith,
Cause the musicians play me that sad note
I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating
On that celestial harmony I go to.
[Sad and solemn music.]

GRIFFITH
She is asleep. Good wench, let's sit down quiet,
For fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience.

[The Vision.

Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six
Personages clad in white robes, wearing on their
heads garlands of bays, and golden vizards on their
faces, branches of bays or palm in their hands. They
first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain
changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her
head, at which the other four make reverent curtsies.
Then the two that held the garland deliver the same
to the other next two, who observe the same order in
their changes and holding the garland over her head;
which done, they deliver the same garland to the last
two, who likewise observe the same order. At which,
as it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep
signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to
heaven; and so, in their dancing, vanish, carrying
the garland with them.]

[The music continues.]

KATHERINE, [waking]
Spirits of peace, where are you? Are you all gone,
And leave me here in wretchedness behind you?

GRIFFITH
Madam, we are here.

KATHERINE  It is not you I call for.
Saw you none enter since I slept?

GRIFFITH  None, madam.

No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
Invite me to a banquet, whose bright faces
Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?
They promised me eternal happiness
And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
I am not worthy yet to wear. I shall, assuredly.

GRIFFITH
I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
Possess your fancy.

KATHERINE  Bid the music leave.
They are harsh and heavy to me.	[Music ceases.]

PATIENCE, [aside to Griffith]  Do you note
How much her Grace is altered on the sudden?
How long her face is drawn? How pale she looks,
And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes.

GRIFFITH, [aside to Patience]
She is going, wench. Pray, pray.

PATIENCE  Heaven comfort her!


MESSENGER, [to Katherine]
An 't like your Grace--

KATHERINE  You are a saucy fellow.
Deserve we no more reverence?

GRIFFITH, [to Messenger]  You are to blame,
Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,
To use so rude behavior. Go to. Kneel.

MESSENGER, [kneeling]
I humbly do entreat your Highness' pardon.
My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying
A gentleman sent from the King to see you.

Admit him entrance, Griffith.	[Messenger rises.]
But this fellow
Let me ne'er see again.	[Messenger exits.]

[Enter Lord Capuchius.]

If my sight fail not,
You should be Lord Ambassador from the Emperor,
My royal nephew, and your name Capuchius.

CAPUCHIUS
Madam, the same. Your servant.

KATHERINE  O my lord,
The times and titles now are altered strangely
With me since first you knew me. But I pray you,
What is your pleasure with me?

CAPUCHIUS  Noble lady,
First, mine own service to your Grace; the next,
The King's request that I would visit you,
Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me
Sends you his princely commendations,
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.

O, my good lord, that comfort comes too late;
'Tis like a pardon after execution.
That gentle physic given in time had cured me.
But now I am past all comforts here but prayers.
How does his Highness?

CAPUCHIUS  Madam, in good health.

So may he ever do, and ever flourish,
When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name
Banished the kingdom.--Patience, is that letter
I caused you write yet sent away?

PATIENCE  No, madam.
[She presents a paper to Katherine, who gives
it to Capuchius.]

Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver
This to my lord the King--

CAPUCHIUS  Most willing, madam.

In which I have commended to his goodness
The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter--
The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!--
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--
She is young and of a noble, modest nature;
I hope she will deserve well--and a little
To love her for her mother's sake that loved him,
Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition
Is that his noble Grace would have some pity
Upon my wretched women, that so long
Have followed both my fortunes faithfully,
Of which there is not one, I dare avow--
And now I should not lie--but will deserve,
For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
For honesty and decent carriage,
A right good husband. Let him be a noble;
And sure those men are happy that shall have 'em.
The last is for my men--they are the poorest,
But poverty could never draw 'em from me--
That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,
And something over to remember me by.
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
And able means, we had not parted thus.
These are the whole contents. And, good my lord,
By that you love the dearest in this world,
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,
Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the King
To do me this last right.

CAPUCHIUS  By heaven, I will,
Or let me lose the fashion of a man!

I thank you, honest lord. Remember me
In all humility unto his Highness.
Say his long trouble now is passing
Out of this world. Tell him in death I blessed him,
For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
My lord.--Griffith, farewell.--Nay, Patience,
You must not leave me yet. I must to bed;
Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,
Let me be used with honor. Strew me over
With maiden flowers, that all the world may know
I was a chaste wife to my grave. Embalm me,
Then lay me forth. Although unqueened, yet like
A queen and daughter to a king inter me.
I can no more.
[They exit, leading Katherine.]

[Enter Caesar, Antony for the course, Calphurnia, Portia,
Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer;
after them Marullus and Flavius and Commoners.]

Calphurnia.

CASCA  Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.

CAESAR  Calphurnia.

CALPHURNIA  Here, my lord.

Stand you directly in Antonius' way
When he doth run his course.--Antonius.

ANTONY  Caesar, my lord.

Forget not in your speed, Antonius,
To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say
The barren, touched in this holy chase,
Shake off their sterile curse.

ANTONY  I shall remember.
When Caesar says "Do this," it is performed.

Set on and leave no ceremony out.	[Sennet.]

SOOTHSAYER  Caesar.

CAESAR  Ha! Who calls?

Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again!

Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue shriller than all the music
Cry "Caesar." Speak. Caesar is turned to hear.

Beware the ides of March.

CAESAR  What man is that?

A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.

Set him before me. Let me see his face.

Fellow, come from the throng.
[The Soothsayer comes forward.]
Look upon Caesar.

What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again.

SOOTHSAYER  Beware the ides of March.

He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass.
[Sennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit.]

Will you go see the order of the course?

BRUTUS  Not I.

CASSIUS  I pray you, do.

I am not gamesome. I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires.
I'll leave you.

Brutus, I do observe you now of late.
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have.
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you.

BRUTUS  Cassius,
Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look,
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself,
Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors.
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved
(Among which number, Cassius, be you one)
Nor construe any further my neglect
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Forgets the shows of love to other men.

Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?

No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
But by reflection, by some other things.

CASSIUS  'Tis just.
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
That you might see your shadow. I have heard
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.

Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me?

Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.
Were I a common laughter, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester; if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them, or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
[Flourish and shout.]

What means this shouting? I do fear the people
Choose Caesar for their king.

CASSIUS  Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.

I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honor in one eye and death i' th' other
And I will look on both indifferently;
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honor more than I fear death.

I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favor.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar; so were you;
We both have fed as well, and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he.
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Caesar said to me "Dar'st thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry flood
And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,
Accoutered as I was, I plunged in
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
The torrent roared, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Caesar cried "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!"
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake.
His coward lips did from their color fly,
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
"Alas," it cried "Give me some drink, Titinius"
As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone.
[Shout. Flourish.]

BRUTUS  Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.

Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
"Brutus" and "Caesar"--what should be in that
"Caesar"?
Why should that name be sounded more than
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
"Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar."
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,
That her wide walks encompassed but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough
When there is in it but one only man.
O, you and I have heard our fathers say
There was a Brutus once that would have brooked
Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king.

That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.
What you would work me to, I have some aim.
How I have thought of this, and of these times,
I shall recount hereafter. For this present,
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
Be any further moved. What you have said
I will consider; what you have to say
I will with patience hear, and find a time
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us.

CASSIUS  I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from

[Enter Caesar and his train.]

The games are done, and Caesar is returning.

As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
What hath proceeded worthy note today.

I will do so. But look you, Cassius,
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
And all the rest look like a chidden train.
Calphurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol,
Being crossed in conference by some senators.

Casca will tell us what the matter is.

CAESAR  Antonius.

ANTONY  Caesar.

Let me have men about me that are fat,
Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights.
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.
He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous.

Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous.
He is a noble Roman, and well given.

Would he were fatter! But I fear him not.
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,
He is a great observer, and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit
That could be moved to smile at anything.
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
And therefore are they very dangerous.
I rather tell thee what is to be feared
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
[Sennet. Caesar and his train exit
but Casca remains behind.]

CASCA  You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak

Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today
That Caesar looks so sad.

CASCA  Why, you were with him, were you not?

I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.

CASCA  Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being
offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
thus, and then the people fell a-shouting.

BRUTUS  What was the second noise for?

CASCA  Why, for that too.

They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?

CASCA  Why, for that too.

BRUTUS  Was the crown offered him thrice?

CASCA  Ay, marry, was 't, and he put it by thrice, every
time gentler than other; and at every putting-by,
mine honest neighbors shouted.

CASSIUS  Who offered him the crown?

CASCA  Why, Antony.

Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.

CASCA  I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.
It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
Antony offer him a crown (yet 'twas not a crown
neither; 'twas one of these coronets), and, as I told
you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my
thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered
it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my
thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.
And then he offered it the third time. He put it the
third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement
hooted and clapped their chopped hands and
threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a
deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the
crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he
swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part,
I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and
receiving the bad air.

But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?

CASCA  He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at
mouth and was speechless.

'Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness.

No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.

CASCA  I know not what you mean by that, but I am
sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
displeased them, as they use to do the players in the
theater, I am no true man.

What said he when he came unto himself?

CASCA  Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived
the common herd was glad he refused the crown,
he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation,
if I would not have taken him at a word, I
would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he
had done or said anything amiss, he desired their
Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four
wenches where I stood cried "Alas, good soul!" and
forgave him with all their hearts. But there's no
heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed
their mothers, they would have done no less.

And, after that, he came thus sad away?

CASCA  Ay.

CASSIUS  Did Cicero say anything?

CASCA  Ay, he spoke Greek.

CASSIUS  To what effect?

CASCA  Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' th'
face again. But those that understood him smiled at
one another and shook their heads. But for mine
own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves
off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember

CASSIUS  Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?

CASCA  No, I am promised forth.

CASSIUS  Will you dine with me tomorrow?

CASCA  Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your
dinner worth the eating.

CASSIUS  Good. I will expect you.

CASCA  Do so. Farewell both.	[He exits.]

What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.

So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise,
However he puts on this tardy form.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
With better appetite.

And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,
I will come home to you; or, if you will,
Come home to me, and I will wait for you.

I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
[Brutus exits.]
Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see
Thy honorable mettle may be wrought
From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.
If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,
He should not humor me. I will this night
In several hands in at his windows throw,
As if they came from several citizens,
Writings, all tending to the great opinion
That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at
And after this, let Caesar seat him sure,
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.

[Enter Constance, Arthur, and Salisbury.]

CONSTANCE, [to Salisbury]
Gone to be married? Gone to swear a peace?
False blood to false blood joined? Gone to be friends?
Shall Louis have Blanche and Blanche those
provinces?
It is not so. Thou hast misspoke, misheard.
Be well advised; tell o'er thy tale again.
It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so.
I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word
Is but the vain breath of a common man.
Believe me, I do not believe thee, man.
I have a king's oath to the contrary.
Thou shalt be punished for thus flighting me,
For I am sick and capable of fears,
Oppressed with wrongs and therefore full of fears,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,
A woman naturally born to fears.
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
With my vexed spirits I cannot take a truce,
But they will quake and tremble all this day.
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
Then speak again--not all thy former tale,
But this one word, whether thy tale be true.

As true as I believe you think them false
That give you cause to prove my saying true.

O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,
And let belief and life encounter so
As doth the fury of two desperate men
Which in the very meeting fall and die.
Louis marry Blanche?--O, boy, then where art
thou?--
France friend with England? What becomes of me?
Fellow, be gone. I cannot brook thy sight.
This news hath made thee a most ugly man.

What other harm have I, good lady, done
But spoke the harm that is by others done?

Which harm within itself so heinous is
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.

I do beseech you, madam, be content.

If thou that bidd'st me be content wert grim,
Ugly, and sland'rous to thy mother's womb,
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
Patched with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
I would not care; I then would be content,
For then I should not love thee; no, nor thou
Become thy great birth, nor deserve a crown.
But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
Nature and Fortune joined to make thee great.
Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
She is corrupted, changed, and won from thee;
Sh' adulterates hourly with thine Uncle John,
And with her golden hand hath plucked on France
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John.--
Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
And leave those woes alone which I alone
Am bound to underbear.

SALISBURY  Pardon me, madam,
I may not go without you to the Kings.

Thou mayst, thou shalt, I will not go with thee.
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud,
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
[She sits down.]
To me and to the state of my great grief
Let kings assemble, for my grief 's so great
That no supporter but the huge firm Earth
Can hold it up. Here I and sorrows sit.
Here is my throne; bid kings come bow to it.

[Enter King John, hand in hand with King Philip of
France, Louis the Dauphin, Blanche, Queen Eleanor,
Bastard, Austria, and Attendants.]

KING PHILIP, [to Blanche]
'Tis true, fair daughter, and this blessed day
Ever in France shall be kept festival.
To solemnize this day the glorious sun
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,
Turning with splendor of his precious eye
The meager cloddy earth to glittering gold.
The yearly course that brings this day about
Shall never see it but a holy day.

CONSTANCE, [rising]
A wicked day, and not a holy day!
What hath this day deserved? What hath it done
That it in golden letters should be set
Among the high tides in the calendar?
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
This day of shame, oppression, perjury.
Or if it must stand still, let wives with child
Pray that their burdens may not fall this day,
Lest that their hopes prodigiously be crossed.
But on this day let seamen fear no wrack;
No bargains break that are not this day made;
This day, all things begun come to ill end,
Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!

By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
To curse the fair proceedings of this day.
Have I not pawned to you my majesty?

You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
Resembling majesty, which, being touched and tried,
Proves valueless. You are forsworn, forsworn.
You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours.
The grappling vigor and rough frown of war
Is cold in amity and painted peace,
And our oppression hath made up this league.
Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured
kings!
A widow cries; be husband to me, God!
Let not the hours of this ungodly day
Wear out the days in peace, but ere sunset
Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings.
Hear me, O, hear me!

AUSTRIA  Lady Constance, peace.

War, war, no peace! Peace is to me a war.
O Limoges, O Austria, thou dost shame
That bloody spoil. Thou slave, thou wretch, thou
Thou little valiant, great in villainy,
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side,
Thou Fortune's champion, that dost never fight
But when her humorous Ladyship is by
To teach thee safety. Thou art perjured too,
And sooth'st up greatness. What a fool art thou,
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
Upon my party. Thou cold-blooded slave,
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side?
Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength?
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
Thou wear a lion's hide! Doff it for shame,
And hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs.

O, that a man should speak those words to me!

"And hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs."

Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life!

"And hang a calfskin on those recreant limbs."

We like not this. Thou dost forget thyself.


Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.

Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
I, Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
Do in his name religiously demand
Why thou against the Church, our holy mother,
So willfully dost spurn, and force perforce
Keep Stephen Langton, chosen Archbishop
Of Canterbury, from that Holy See.
This, in our foresaid Holy Father's name,
Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.

What earthy name to interrogatories
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
So slight, unworthy, and ridiculous
To charge me to an answer, as the Pope.
Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England
Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
But as we under God are supreme head,
So, under Him, that great supremacy
Where we do reign we will alone uphold
Without th' assistance of a mortal hand.
So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart
To him and his usurped authority.

Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.

Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
Dreading the curse that money may buy out,
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
Though you and all the rest, so grossly led,
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes.

Then, by the lawful power that I have,
Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate;
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
From his allegiance to an heretic;
And meritorious shall that hand be called,
Canonized and worshiped as a saint,
That takes away by any secret course
Thy hateful life.

CONSTANCE  O, lawful let it be
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
Good father cardinal, cry thou "Amen"
To my keen curses, for without my wrong
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.

There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.

And for mine, too. When law can do no right,
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong.
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law.
Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?

Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic,
And raise the power of France upon his head
Unless he do submit himself to Rome.

Look'st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.

Look to that, devil, lest that France repent
And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.

King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.

And hang a calfskin on his recreant limbs.

Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
Because--

BASTARD  Your breeches best may carry them.

Philip, what sayst thou to the Cardinal?

What should he say, but as the Cardinal?

Bethink you, father, for the difference
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,
Or the light loss of England for a friend.
Forgo the easier.

BLANCHE  That's the curse of Rome.

O Louis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.

The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
But from her need.

CONSTANCE, [to King Philip]
O, if thou grant my need,
Which only lives but by the death of faith,
That need must needs infer this principle:
That faith would live again by death of need.
O, then tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down.

The King is moved, and answers not to this.

CONSTANCE, [to King Philip]
O, be removed from him, and answer well!

Do so, King Philip. Hang no more in doubt.

Hang nothing but a calfskin, most sweet lout.

I am perplexed and know not what to say.

What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?

Good reverend father, make my person yours,
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
And the conjunction of our inward souls
Married, in league, coupled, and linked together
With all religious strength of sacred vows.
The latest breath that gave the sound of words
Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves;
And even before this truce, but new before,
No longer than we well could wash our hands
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
God knows they were besmeared and overstained
With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
The fearful difference of incensed kings.
And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,
So newly joined in love, so strong in both,
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
Play fast and loose with faith? So jest with heaven?
Make such unconstant children of ourselves
As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage bed
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host
And make a riot on the gentle brow
Of true sincerity? O holy sir,
My reverend father, let it not be so!
Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest
To do your pleasure and continue friends.

All form is formless, order orderless,
Save what is opposite to England's love.
Therefore to arms! Be champion of our Church,
Or let the Church, our mother, breathe her curse,
A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.

I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.

So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith,
And like a civil war sett'st oath to oath,
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
First made to God, first be to God performed,
That is, to be the champion of our Church!
What since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself
And may not be performed by thyself,
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
Is not amiss when it is truly done;
And being not done where doing tends to ill,
The truth is then most done not doing it.
The better act of purposes mistook
Is to mistake again; though indirect,
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
Within the scorched veins of one new-burned.
It is religion that doth make vows kept,
But thou hast sworn against religion
By what thou swear'st against the thing thou
swear'st,
And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth
Against an oath. The truth thou art unsure
To swear swears only not to be forsworn,
Else what a mockery should it be to swear?
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn,
And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear.
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself.
And better conquest never canst thou make
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Against these giddy loose suggestions,
Upon which better part our prayers come in,
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
The peril of our curses light on thee
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
But in despair die under their black weight.

Rebellion, flat rebellion!

BASTARD  Will 't not be?
Will not a calfskin stop that mouth of thine?

Father, to arms!

BLANCHE  Upon thy wedding day?
Against the blood that thou hast married?
What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men?
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
Clamors of hell, be measures to our pomp?
O husband, hear me! Ay, alack, how new
Is "husband" in my mouth! Even for that name,
Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,
Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
Against mine uncle.

CONSTANCE, [kneeling]
O, upon my knee
Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,
Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
Forethought by heaven!

BLANCHE, [to Dauphin]
Now shall I see thy love. What motive may
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?

That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
His honor.--O, thine honor, Louis, thine honor!

DAUPHIN, [to King Philip]
I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold,
When such profound respects do pull you on.

I will denounce a curse upon his head.

KING PHILIP, [dropping King John's hand]
Thou shalt not need.--England, I will fall from

CONSTANCE, [rising]
O, fair return of banished majesty!

O, foul revolt of French inconstancy!

France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.

Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
Is it as he will? Well, then, France shall rue.

BLANCHE, [rising]
The sun's o'ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu.
Which is the side that I must go withal?
I am with both, each army hath a hand,
And in their rage, I having hold of both,
They whirl asunder and dismember me.
Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win.--
Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose.--
Father, I may not wish the fortune thine.--
Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive.
Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose.
Assured loss before the match be played.

Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.

There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.

Cousin, go draw our puissance together.
[Bastard exits.]
France, I am burned up with inflaming wrath,
A rage whose heat hath this condition,
That nothing can allay, nothing but blood--
The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.

Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
To ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire.
Look to thyself. Thou art in jeopardy.

No more than he that threats.--To arms let's hie!

[Alarums. Enter King John and Hubert.]

How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.

Badly, I fear. How fares your Majesty?

This fever that hath troubled me so long
Lies heavy on me. O, my heart is sick.


My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
Desires your Majesty to leave the field
And send him word by me which way you go.

Tell him toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.

Be of good comfort, for the great supply
That was expected by the Dauphin here
Are wracked three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.
This news was brought to Richard but even now.
The French fight coldly and retire themselves.

Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up
And will not let me welcome this good news.
Set on toward Swinstead. To my litter straight.
Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.

[Enter Salisbury, Pembroke, and Bigot.]

I did not think the King so stored with friends.

Up once again. Put spirit in the French.
If they miscarry, we miscarry too.

That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.

They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.

[Enter Melun, wounded, led by a Soldier.]

MELUN
Lead me to the revolts of England here.

When we were happy, we had other names.

It is the Count Melun.

SALISBURY  Wounded to death.

MELUN
Fly, noble English; you are bought and sold.
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
And welcome home again discarded faith.
Seek out King John and fall before his feet,
For if the French be lords of this loud day,
He means to recompense the pains you take
By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn,
And I with him, and many more with me,
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury,
Even on that altar where we swore to you
Dear amity and everlasting love.

May this be possible? May this be true?

MELUN
Have I not hideous death within my view,
Retaining but a quantity of life,
Which bleeds away even as a form of wax
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
What in the world should make me now deceive,
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
Why should I then be false, since it is true
That I must die here and live hence by truth?
I say again, if Louis do win the day,
He is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours
Behold another daybreak in the East.
But even this night, whose black contagious breath
Already smokes about the burning crest
Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,
Even this ill night your breathing shall expire,
Paying the fine of rated treachery
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
If Louis by your assistance win the day.
Commend me to one Hubert with your king;
The love of him, and this respect besides,
For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
In lieu whereof, I pray you bear me hence
From forth the noise and rumor of the field,
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
In peace, and part this body and my soul
With contemplation and devout desires.

We do believe thee, and beshrew my soul
But I do love the favor and the form
Of this most fair occasion, by the which
We will untread the steps of damned flight,
And like a bated and retired flood,
Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlooked
And calmly run on in obedience
Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence,
For I do see the cruel pangs of death
Right in thine eye.--Away, my friends! New flight,
And happy newness, that intends old right.
[They exit, assisting Melun.]

[Enter Edmund, the Bastard and Curan, severally.]

EDMUND  Save thee, Curan.

CURAN  And you, sir. I have been with your father and
given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and
Regan his duchess will be here with him this night.

EDMUND  How comes that?

CURAN  Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news
abroad?--I mean the whispered ones, for they are
yet but ear-kissing arguments.

EDMUND  Not I. Pray you, what are they?

CURAN  Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt
the dukes of Cornwall and Albany?

EDMUND  Not a word.

CURAN  You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.

The Duke be here tonight? The better, best.
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
My father hath set guard to take my brother,
And I have one thing of a queasy question
Which I must act. Briefness and fortune work!--
Brother, a word. Descend. Brother, I say!


My father watches. O sir, fly this place!
Intelligence is given where you are hid.
You have now the good advantage of the night.
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
He's coming hither, now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,
And Regan with him. Have you nothing said
Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
Advise yourself.

EDGAR  I am sure on 't, not a word.

I hear my father coming. Pardon me.
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.
Draw. Seem to defend yourself. Now, quit you
well.	[They draw.]
Yield! Come before my father! Light, hoa, here!
[Aside to Edgar.] Fly, brother.--Torches, torches!
--So, farewell.	[Edgar exits.]
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
Of my more fierce endeavor. I have seen drunkards
Do more than this in sport.	[He wounds his arm.]
Father, father!
Stop, stop! No help?

[Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.]

GLOUCESTER  Now, Edmund, where's the
villain?

Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
To stand auspicious mistress.

GLOUCESTER  But where is he?

Look, sir, I bleed.

GLOUCESTER  Where is the villain,
Edmund?

Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could--

Pursue him, ho! Go after. [Servants exit.] By no
means what?

Persuade me to the murder of your Lordship,
But that I told him the revenging gods
'Gainst parricides did all the thunder bend,
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to th' father--sir, in fine,
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion
With his prepared sword he charges home
My unprovided body, lanced mine arm;
And when he saw my best alarumed spirits,
Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to th' encounter,
Or whether ghasted by the noise I made,
Full suddenly he fled.

GLOUCESTER  Let him fly far!
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught,
And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.
By his authority I will proclaim it
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
He that conceals him, death.

When I dissuaded him from his intent
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
I threatened to discover him. He replied
"Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
Make thy words faithed? No. What I should
deny--
As this I would, though thou didst produce
My very character--I'd turn it all
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice.
And thou must make a dullard of the world
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it."

GLOUCESTER  O strange and fastened villain!
Would he deny his letter, said he?
I never got him.	[Tucket within.]
Hark, the Duke's trumpets. I know not why he
All ports I'll bar. The villain shall not 'scape.
The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
May have due note of him. And of my land,
Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
To make thee capable.

[Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.]

How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither,
Which I can call but now, I have heard strange
news.

If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my

O madam, my old heart is cracked; it's cracked.

What, did my father's godson seek your life?
He whom my father named, your Edgar?

O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!

Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tended upon my father?

I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad.

Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

No marvel, then, though he were ill affected.
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.
I have this present evening from my sister
Been well informed of them, and with such cautions
That if they come to sojourn at my house
I'll not be there.

CORNWALL  Nor I, assure thee, Regan.--
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
A childlike office.

EDMUND  It was my duty, sir.

He did bewray his practice, and received
This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.

CORNWALL  Is he pursued?

GLOUCESTER  Ay, my good lord.

If he be taken, he shall never more
Be feared of doing harm. Make your own purpose,
How in my strength you please.--For you, Edmund,
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
So much commend itself, you shall be ours.
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need.
You we first seize on.

EDMUND  I shall serve you, sir,
Truly, however else.

GLOUCESTER  For him I thank your Grace.

You know not why we came to visit you--

Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night.
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
Wherein we must have use of your advice.
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
Of differences, which I best thought it fit
To answer from our home. The several messengers
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
Lay comforts to your bosom and bestow
Your needful counsel to our businesses,
Which craves the instant use.

GLOUCESTER  I serve you, madam.
Your Graces are right welcome.

[Enter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman.]

'Tis strange that they should so depart from home
And not send back my messenger.

GENTLEMAN  As I learned,
The night before there was no purpose in them
Of this remove.

KENT, [waking]  Hail to thee, noble master.

LEAR  Ha?
Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?

KENT  No, my lord.

FOOL  Ha, ha, he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied
by the heads, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys
by th' loins, and men by th' legs. When a man's
overlusty at legs, then he wears wooden
netherstocks.

What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here?

KENT  It is both he and she,
Your son and daughter.


KENT  Yes.

LEAR  No, I say.

KENT  I say yea.

LEAR  By Jupiter, I swear no.

KENTBy Juno, I swear ay.

LEAR  They durst not do 't.
They could not, would not do 't. 'Tis worse than
murder
To do upon respect such violent outrage.
Resolve me with all modest haste which way
Thou might'st deserve or they impose this usage,
Coming from us.

KENT  My lord, when at their home
I did commend your Highness' letters to them,
Ere I was risen from the place that showed
My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
Stewed in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
From Goneril his mistress salutations;
Delivered letters, spite of intermission,
Which presently they read; on whose contents
They summoned up their meiny, straight took
horse,
Commanded me to follow and attend
The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks;
And meeting here the other messenger,
Whose welcome, I perceived, had poisoned mine,
Being the very fellow which of late
Displayed so saucily against your Highness,
Having more man than wit about me, drew.
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers.

FOOL  Winter's not gone yet if the wild geese fly that
	Fathers that wear rags
	   Do make their children blind,
	But fathers that bear bags
	   Shall see their children kind.
	Fortune, that arrant whore,
	Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.
But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolors for
thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.

O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow!
Thy element's below.--Where is this daughter?

KENT  With the Earl, sir, here within.

LEAR, [to Fool and Gentleman]  Follow me not. Stay
here.	[He exits.]

Made you no more offense but what you speak of?

KENT  None.
How chance the King comes with so small a number?

FOOL  An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that
question, thou 'dst well deserved it.

KENT  Why, Fool?

FOOL  We'll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee
there's no laboring i' th' winter. All that follow
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men, and
there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with following;
but the great one that goes upward, let him
draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better
counsel, give me mine again. I would have none but
knaves follow it, since a Fool gives it.
	That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
	   And follows but for form,
	Will pack when it begins to rain
	   And leave thee in the storm.
	But I will tarry; the Fool will stay,
	   And let the wise man fly.
	The knave turns fool that runs away;
	   The Fool no knave, perdie.

KENT  Where learned you this, Fool?

FOOL  Not i' th' stocks, fool.

[Enter Lear and Gloucester.]

Deny to speak with me? They are sick? They are
weary?
They have traveled all the night? Mere fetches,
The images of revolt and flying off.
Fetch me a better answer.

GLOUCESTER  My dear lord,
You know the fiery quality of the Duke,
How unremovable and fixed he is
In his own course.

Vengeance, plague, death, confusion!
"Fiery"? What "quality"? Why Gloucester,
I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.

Well, my good lord, I have informed them so.

"Informed them"? Dost thou understand me,

GLOUCESTER  Ay, my good lord.

The King would speak with Cornwall. The dear
father
Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends
Are they "informed" of this? My breath and
blood!
"Fiery"? The "fiery" duke? Tell the hot duke that--
No, but not yet. Maybe he is not well.
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves
When nature, being oppressed, commands the mind
To suffer with the body. I'll forbear,
And am fallen out with my more headier will,
To take the indisposed and sickly fit
For the sound man. [Noticing Kent again.] Death on
my state! Wherefore
Should he sit here? This act persuades me
That this remotion of the Duke and her
Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'd speak with them.
Now, presently, bid them come forth and hear me,
Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
Till it cry sleep to death.

GLOUCESTER  I would have all well betwixt you.

O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!

FOOL  Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels
when she put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapped
'em o' th' coxcombs with a stick and cried "Down,
wantons, down!" 'Twas her brother that in pure
kindness to his horse buttered his hay.

[Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.]

LEAR  Good morrow to you both.

CORNWALL  Hail to your Grace.
[Kent here set at liberty.]

REGAN  I am glad to see your Highness.

Regan, I think you are. I know what reason
I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
Sepulch'ring an adult'ress. [To Kent.] O, are you
free?
Some other time for that.--Beloved Regan,
Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied
Sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here.
I can scarce speak to thee. Thou 'lt not believe
With how depraved a quality--O Regan!

I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty.

LEAR  Say? How is that?

I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance
She have restrained the riots of your followers,
'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end
As clears her from all blame.

LEAR  My curses on her.

REGAN  O sir, you are old.
Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of his confine. You should be ruled and led
By some discretion that discerns your state
Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you
That to our sister you do make return.
Say you have wronged her.

LEAR  Ask her forgiveness?
Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
"Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.
Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg
That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food."

Good sir, no more. These are unsightly tricks.
Return you to my sister.

LEAR, [rising]  Never, Regan.
She hath abated me of half my train,
Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue
Most serpentlike upon the very heart.
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
You taking airs, with lameness!

CORNWALL  Fie, sir, fie!

You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun
To fall and blister!

O, the blest gods! So will you wish on me
When the rash mood is on.

No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but
thine
Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
Against my coming in. Thou better know'st
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.
Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,
Wherein I thee endowed.

REGAN  Good sir, to th' purpose.
[Tucket within.]

Who put my man i' th' stocks?

CORNWALL  What trumpet's that?

I know 't--my sister's. This approves her letter,
That she would soon be here.


Is your lady come?

This is a slave whose easy-borrowed pride
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.--
Out, varlet, from my sight!

CORNWALL  What means your Grace?

Who stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hope
Thou didst not know on 't.


Who comes here? O heavens,
If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
Allow obedience, if you yourselves are old,
Make it your cause. Send down and take my part.
[To Goneril.] Art not ashamed to look upon this
beard?	[Regan takes Goneril's hand.]
O Regan, will you take her by the hand?

Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?
All's not offense that indiscretion finds
And dotage terms so.

LEAR  O sides, you are too tough!
Will you yet hold?--How came my man i' th'
stocks?

I set him there, sir, but his own disorders
Deserved much less advancement.

LEAR  You? Did you?

I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
If till the expiration of your month
You will return and sojourn with my sister,
Dismissing half your train, come then to me.
I am now from home and out of that provision
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.

Return to her? And fifty men dismissed?
No! Rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
To wage against the enmity o' th' air,
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,
Necessity's sharp pinch. Return with her?
Why the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
Our youngest born--I could as well be brought
To knee his throne and, squire-like, pension beg
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
To this detested groom.	[He indicates Oswald.]

GONERIL  At your choice, sir.

I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.
I will not trouble thee, my child. Farewell.
We'll no more meet, no more see one another.
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter,
Or, rather, a disease that's in my flesh,
Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,
A plague-sore or embossed carbuncle
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.
Let shame come when it will; I do not call it.
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.
Mend when thou canst. Be better at thy leisure.
I can be patient. I can stay with Regan,
I and my hundred knights.

REGAN  Not altogether so.
I looked not for you yet, nor am provided
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister,
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old, and so--
But she knows what she does.

LEAR  Is this well spoken?

I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?
Is it not well? What should you need of more?
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house
Should many people under two commands
Hold amity? 'Tis hard, almost impossible.

Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
From those that she calls servants, or from mine?

Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack
We could control them. If you will come to me
(For now I spy a danger), I entreat you
To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more
Will I give place or notice.

LEAR  I gave you all--

REGAN  And in good time you gave it.

Made you my guardians, my depositaries,
But kept a reservation to be followed
With such a number. What, must I come to you
With five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?

And speak 't again, my lord. No more with me.

Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favored
When others are more wicked. Not being the worst
Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril.] I'll go
Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
And thou art twice her love.

GONERIL  Hear me, my lord.
What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,
To follow in a house where twice so many
Have a command to tend you?

REGAN  What need one?

O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars
Are in the poorest thing superfluous.
Allow not nature more than nature needs,
Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady;
If only to go warm were gorgeous,
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true
need--
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man
As full of grief as age, wretched in both.
If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
Against their father, fool me not so much
To bear it tamely. Touch me with noble anger,
And let not women's weapons, water drops,
Stain my man's cheeks.--No, you unnatural hags,
I will have such revenges on you both
That all the world shall--I will do such things--
What they are yet I know not, but they shall be
The terrors of the Earth! You think I'll weep.
No, I'll not weep.
I have full cause of weeping, but this heart
[Storm and tempest.]
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
Or ere I'll weep.--O Fool, I shall go mad!
[Lear, Kent, and Fool exit
with Gloucester and the Gentleman.]

CORNWALL  Let us withdraw. 'Twill be a storm.

This house is little. The old man and 's people
Cannot be well bestowed.

'Tis his own blame hath put himself from rest,
And must needs taste his folly.

For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
But not one follower.

So am I purposed. Where is my lord of Gloucester?

Followed the old man forth.


He is returned.

GLOUCESTER  The King is in high rage.

CORNWALL  Whither is he going?

He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.

'Tis best to give him way. He leads himself.

GONERIL, [to Gloucester]
My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds
Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about
There's scarce a bush.

REGAN  O sir, to willful men
The injuries that they themselves procure
Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.
He is attended with a desperate train,
And what they may incense him to, being apt
To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.

Shut up your doors, my lord. 'Tis a wild night.
My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.



[Enter Braggart Armado and his Boy.]

ARMADO  Warble, child, make passionate my sense of
hearing.

BOY [sings]  Concolinel.

ARMADO  Sweet air. Go, tenderness of years. [He hands
over a key.] Take this key, give enlargement to the
swain, bring him festinately hither. I must employ
him in a letter to my love.

BOY  Master, will you win your love with a French
brawl?

ARMADO  How meanest thou? Brawling in French?

BOY  No, my complete master, but to jig off a tune at the
tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humor it
with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and sing a
note, sometimes through the throat as if you
swallowed love with singing love, sometimes
through the nose as if you snuffed up love by
smelling love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the
shop of your eyes, with your arms crossed on your
thin-belly doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your
hands in your pocket like a man after the old
painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a
snip and away. These are compliments, these are
humors; these betray nice wenches that would be
betrayed without these, and make them men of
note--do you note me?--that most are affected
to these.

ARMADO  How hast thou purchased this experience?

BOY  By my penny of observation.

ARMADO  But O-- but O--.

BOY  "The hobby-horse is forgot."

ARMADO  Call'st thou my love "hobby-horse"?

BOY  No, master. The hobby-horse is but a colt, [aside]
and your love perhaps a hackney.--But have you
forgot your love?

ARMADO  Almost I had.

BOY  Negligent student, learn her by heart.

ARMADO  By heart and in heart, boy.

BOY  And out of heart, master. All those three I will

ARMADO  What wilt thou prove?

BOY  A man, if I live; and this "by, in, and without,"
upon the instant: "by" heart you love her, because
your heart cannot come by her; "in" heart you love
her, because your heart is in love with her; and
"out" of heart you love her, being out of heart that
you cannot enjoy her.

ARMADO  I am all these three.

BOY  And three times as much more, [aside] and yet
nothing at all.

ARMADO  Fetch hither the swain. He must carry me a
letter.

BOY  A message well sympathized--a horse to be ambassador
for an ass.

ARMADO  Ha? Ha? What sayest thou?

BOY  Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.

ARMADO  The way is but short. Away!

BOY  As swift as lead, sir.

ARMADO  Thy meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?

Minime, honest master, or rather, master, no.

I say lead is slow.

BOY  You are too swift, sir, to say so.
Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?

ARMADO  Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
He reputes me a cannon, and the bullet, that's
he.--
I shoot thee at the swain.

BOY  Thump, then, and I flee.

A most acute juvenal, voluble and free of grace.
By thy favor, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face.
Most rude melancholy, valor gives thee place.
My herald is returned.

[Enter Boy and Clown Costard.]

BOY  A wonder, master!
Here's a costard broken in a shin.

Some enigma, some riddle. Come, thy l'envoi begin.

COSTARD  No egma, no riddle, no l'envoi, no salve in
the mail, sir. O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! No
l'envoi, no l'envoi, no salve, sir, but a plantain.

ARMADO  By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
thought, my spleen. The heaving of my lungs
provokes me to ridiculous smiling. O pardon me,
my stars! Doth the inconsiderate take salve for
l'envoi, and the word l'envoi for a salve?

Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoi a salve?

No, page, it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
I will example it:
	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee
	Were still at odds, being but three.
There's the moral. Now the l'envoi.

BOY  I will add the l'envoi. Say the moral again.

	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee
	Were still at odds, being but three.

	Until the goose came out of door
	And stayed the odds by adding four.
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
my l'envoi.
	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee
	Were still at odds, being but three.

	Until the goose came out of door,
	Staying the odds by adding four.

BOY  A good l'envoi, ending in the goose. Would you
desire more?

The boy hath sold him a bargain--a goose, that's
flat.--
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and
loose.
Let me see: a fat l'envoi--ay, that's a fat goose.

Come hither, come hither. How did this argument
begin?

By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
Then called you for the l'envoi.

COSTARD  True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your
argument in. Then the boy's fat l'envoi, the goose
that you bought; and he ended the market.

ARMADO  But tell me, how was there a costard broken
in a shin?

BOY  I will tell you sensibly.

COSTARD  Thou hast no feeling of it, Mote. I will speak
that l'envoi.
	I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,
	Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.

ARMADO  We will talk no more of this matter.

COSTARD  Till there be more matter in the shin.

ARMADO  Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.

COSTARD  O, marry me to one Frances! I smell some
l'envoi, some goose, in this.

ARMADO  By my sweet soul, I mean, setting thee at
liberty, enfreedoming thy person. Thou wert immured,
restrained, captivated, bound.

COSTARD  True, true; and now you will be my purgation,
and let me loose.

ARMADO  I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance,
and, in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but
this: bear this significant to the country maid
Jaquenetta. [(He gives him a paper.)] There is remuneration
[(giving him a coin,)] for the best ward of
mine honor is rewarding my dependents.--Mote,
follow.	[He exits.]

BOY  Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.

My sweet ounce of man's flesh, my incony Jew!
Now will I look to his remuneration. [He looks at the
coin.] "Remuneration"! O, that's the Latin word for
three farthings. Three farthings--remuneration.
"What's the price of this inkle?" "One penny." "No,
I'll give you a remuneration." Why, it carries it!
Remuneration. Why, it is a fairer name than "French
crown." I will never buy and sell out of this word.


BEROWNE  My good knave Costard, exceedingly well
met.

COSTARD  Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon
may a man buy for a remuneration?

BEROWNE  What is a remuneration?

COSTARD  Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.

BEROWNE  Why then, three farthing worth of silk.

COSTARD  I thank your Worship. God be wi' you.

BEROWNE  Stay, slave, I must employ thee.
As thou wilt win my favor, good my knave,
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.

COSTARD  When would you have it done, sir?

BEROWNE  This afternoon.

COSTARD  Well, I will do it, sir. Fare you well.

BEROWNE  Thou knowest not what it is.

COSTARD  I shall know, sir, when I have done it.

BEROWNE  Why, villain, thou must know first.

COSTARD  I will come to your Worship tomorrow

BEROWNE  It must be done this afternoon. Hark, slave,
it is but this:
The Princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady.
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her
name,
And Rosaline they call her. Ask for her,
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This sealed-up counsel. There's thy guerdon. [He
gives him money.] Go.

COSTARD  Gardon. [He looks at the money.] O sweet
gardon! Better than remuneration, a 'levenpence
farthing better! Most sweet gardon. I will do it, sir,
in print. Gardon! Remuneration!	[He exits.]

And I forsooth in love! I that have been love's whip,
A very beadle to a humorous sigh,
A critic, nay, a nightwatch constable,
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
Than whom no mortal so magnificent.
This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,
This Signior Junior, giant dwarf, Dan Cupid,
Regent of love rhymes, lord of folded arms,
Th' anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
Sole imperator and great general
Of trotting paritors--O my little heart!
And I to be a corporal of his field
And wear his colors like a tumbler's hoop!
What? I love, I sue, I seek a wife?
A woman, that is like a German clock,
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
And never going aright, being a watch,
But being watched that it may still go right.
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all.
And, among three, to love the worst of all,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes.
Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard.
And I to sigh for her, to watch for her,
To pray for her! Go to. It is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, groan.
Some men must love my lady, and some Joan.


[Enter Holofernes the Pedant, Nathaniel the Curate,
and Dull the Constable.]

HOLOFERNES  Satis quid sufficit.

NATHANIEL  I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at
dinner have been sharp and sententious, pleasant
without scurrility, witty without affection, audacious
without impudency, learned without opinion,
and strange without heresy. I did converse this
quondam day with a companion of the King's, who
is intituled, nominated, or called Don Adriano de
Armado.

HOLOFERNES  Novi hominem tanquam te. His humor
is lofty, his discourse peremptory, his tongue filed,
his eye ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.

NATHANIEL  A most singular and choice epithet.
[Draw out his table book.]

HOLOFERNES  He draweth out the thread of his verbosity
finer than the staple of his argument. I abhor
such fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
point-devise companions, such rackers of orthography,
as to speak "dout," fine, when he should
say "doubt"; "det" when he should pronounce
"debt"--d, e, b, t, not d, e, t. He clepeth a calf
"cauf," half "hauf," neighbor vocatur "nebor";
neigh abbreviated ne. This is abhominable--which
he would call "abominable." It insinuateth me of
insanie. Ne intelligis, domine? To make frantic,
lunatic.

NATHANIEL  Laus Deo, bone intelligo.

HOLOFERNES  Bone? Bone for bene? Priscian a little
scratched; 'twill serve.

[Enter Armado the Braggart, Boy, and Costard.]

NATHANIEL  Videsne quis venit?

HOLOFERNES  Video, et gaudeo.

ARMADO  Chirrah.

HOLOFERNES  Quare "chirrah," not "sirrah"?

ARMADO  Men of peace, well encountered.

HOLOFERNES  Most military sir, salutation.

BOY, [aside to Costard]  They have been at a great feast
of languages and stolen the scraps.

COSTARD, [aside to Boy]  O, they have lived long on the
almsbasket of words. I marvel thy master hath not
eaten thee for a word, for thou art not so long by the
head as honorificabilitudinitatibus. Thou art easier
swallowed than a flapdragon.

BOY, [aside to Costard]  Peace, the peal begins.

ARMADO, [to Holofernes]  Monsieur, are you not
lettered?

BOY  Yes, yes, he teaches boys the hornbook.--What is
a, b spelled backward, with the horn on his head?

HOLOFERNES  Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.

BOY  Ba, most silly sheep, with a horn.--You hear his
learning.

HOLOFERNES  Quis, quis, thou consonant?

BOY  The last of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
the fifth, if I.

HOLOFERNES  I will repeat them: a, e, i--

BOY  The sheep. The other two concludes it: o, u.

ARMADO  Now by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum,
a sweet touch, a quick venue of wit! Snip, snap,
quick and home. It rejoiceth my intellect. True

BOY  Offered by a child to an old man--which is
wit-old.

HOLOFERNES  What is the figure? What is the figure?

BOY  Horns.

HOLOFERNES  Thou disputes like an infant. Go whip thy
gig.

BOY  Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip
about your infamy--unum cita--a gig of a cuckold's
horn.

COSTARD  An I had but one penny in the world, thou
shouldst have it to buy gingerbread! Hold, there is
the very remuneration I had of thy master, thou
halfpenny purse of wit, thou pigeon egg of discretion.
[He gives him money.] O, an the heavens were
so pleased that thou wert but my bastard, what a
joyful father wouldest thou make me! Go to, thou
hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.

HOLOFERNES  Oh, I smell false Latin! Dunghill for
unguem.

ARMADO  Arts-man, preambulate. We will be singuled
from the barbarous. Do you not educate youth at
the charge-house on the top of the mountain?

HOLOFERNES  Or mons, the hill.

ARMADO  At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.

HOLOFERNES  I do, sans question.

ARMADO  Sir, it is the King's most sweet pleasure and
affection to congratulate the Princess at her pavilion
in the posteriors of this day, which the rude
multitude call the afternoon.

HOLOFERNES  "The posterior of the day," most generous
sir, is liable, congruent, and measurable for
"the afternoon"; the word is well culled, chose,
sweet, and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure.

ARMADO  Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my
familiar, I do assure you, very good friend. For
what is inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech
thee, remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee apparel
thy head. And among other important and most
serious designs, and of great import indeed, too--
but let that pass; for I must tell thee, it will please his
Grace, by the world, sometimes to lean upon my
poor shoulder and with his royal finger thus dally
with my excrement, with my mustachio--but,
sweetheart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
fable! Some certain special honors it pleaseth his
Greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
travel, that hath seen the world--but let that pass.
The very all of all is--but sweetheart, I do implore
secrecy--that the King would have me present the
Princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation,
or show, or pageant, or antic, or firework.
Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet
self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking
out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you
withal to the end to crave your assistance.

HOLOFERNES  Sir, you shall present before her the Nine
Worthies.--Sir Nathaniel, as concerning some
entertainment of time, some show in the posterior
of this day, to be rendered by our assistance, the
King's command, and this most gallant, illustrate,
and learned gentleman, before the Princess--I say,
none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.

NATHANIEL  Where will you find men worthy enough to
present them?

HOLOFERNES  Joshua, yourself; myself; and this gallant
gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus. This swain, because
of his great limb or joint, shall pass Pompey
the Great; the page, Hercules--

ARMADO  Pardon, sir--error. He is not quantity
enough for that Worthy's thumb; he is not so big as
the end of his club!

HOLOFERNES  Shall I have audience? He shall present
Hercules in minority. His enter and exit shall be
strangling a snake; and I will have an apology for
that purpose.

BOY  An excellent device. So, if any of the audience
hiss, you may cry "Well done, Hercules, now thou
crushest the snake." That is the way to make an
offense gracious, though few have the grace to do it.

ARMADO  For the rest of the Worthies?

HOLOFERNES  I will play three myself.

BOY  Thrice-worthy gentleman!

ARMADO, [to Holofernes]  Shall I tell you a thing?

HOLOFERNES  We attend.

ARMADO  We will have, if this fadge not, an antic. I
beseech you, follow.

HOLOFERNES  Via, goodman Dull. Thou hast spoken no
word all this while.

DULL  Nor understood none neither, sir.

HOLOFERNES  Allons! We will employ thee.

DULL  I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play on
the tabor to the Worthies and let them dance the
hay.

HOLOFERNES  Most dull, honest Dull. To our sport!
Away.

"It cannot be," quoth she, "that so much guile"--
She would have said "can lurk in such a look,"
But Tarquin's shape came in her mind the while
And from her tongue "can lurk" from "cannot" took.
"It cannot be" she in that sense forsook,
  And turned it thus: "It cannot be, I find,
  But such a face should bear a wicked mind.

"For even as subtle Sinon here is painted
So sober sad, so weary, and so mild,
As if with grief or travail he had fainted,
To me came Tarquin armed too, beguiled
With outward honesty, but yet defiled
  With inward vice. As Priam him did cherish,
  So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.

"Look, look how list'ning Priam wets his eyes
To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheeds!
Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?
For every tear he falls, a Trojan bleeds.
His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds;
  Those round clear pearls of his, that move thy pity,
  Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city.

"Such devils steal effects from lightless hell,
For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,
And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell.
These contraries such unity do hold
Only to flatter fools and make them bold.
  So Priam's trust false Sinon's tears doth flatter,
  That he finds means to burn his Troy with water."

Here, all enraged, such passion her assails
That patience is quite beaten from her breast.
She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
Comparing him to that unhappy guest
Whose deed hath made herself herself detest.
  At last she smilingly with this gives o'er:
  "Fool, fool," quoth she, "his wounds will not be sore."

Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,
And time doth weary time with her complaining.
She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,
And both she thinks too long with her remaining.
Short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining;
  Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,
  And they that watch see time how slow it creeps;

Which all this time hath overslipped her thought
That she with painted images hath spent,
Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
By deep surmise of others' detriment,
Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
  It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
  To think their dolor others have endured.

But now the mindful messenger, come back,
Brings home his lord and other company,
Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black,
And round about her tear-distained eye
Blue circles streamed like rainbows in the sky.
  These water-galls in her dim element
  Foretell new storms to those already spent;

Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,
Amazedly in her sad face he stares.
Her eyes, though sod in tears, looked red and raw,
Her lively color killed with deadly cares.
He hath no power to ask her how she fares;
  Both stood like old acquaintance in a trance,
  Met far from home, wond'ring each other's chance.

At last he takes her by the bloodless hand
And thus begins: "What uncouth ill event
Hath thee befall'n that thou dost trembling stand?
Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair color spent?
Why art thou thus attired in discontent?
  Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,
  And tell thy grief, that we may give redress."

Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire
Ere once she can discharge one word of woe.
At length addressed to answer his desire,
She modestly prepares to let them know
Her honor is ta'en prisoner by the foe,
  While Collatine and his consorted lords
  With sad attention long to hear her words.

And now this pale swan in her wat'ry nest
Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending:
"Few words," quoth she, "shall fit the trespass best
Where no excuse can give the fault amending.
In me moe woes than words are now depending,
  And my laments would be drawn out too long
  To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.

"Then be this all the task it hath to say:
Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed
A stranger came, and on that pillow lay
Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head;
And what wrong else may be imagined
  By foul enforcement might be done to me,
  From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free.

"For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight,
With shining falchion in my chamber came
A creeping creature with a flaming light
And softly cried, "Awake, thou Roman dame,
And entertain my love, else lasting shame
  On thee and thine this night I will inflict
  If thou my love's desire do contradict.

" 'For some hard-favored groom of thine,' quoth he,
'Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will,
I'll murder straight, and then I'll slaughter thee
And swear I found you where you did fulfill
The loathsome act of lust and so did kill
  The lechers in their deed. This act will be
  My fame and thy perpetual infamy.'

"With this, I did begin to start and cry;
And then against my heart he set his sword,
Swearing, unless I took all patiently,
I should not live to speak another word;
So should my shame still rest upon record,
  And never be forgot in mighty Rome
  Th' adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom.

"Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,
And far the weaker with so strong a fear.
My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;
No rightful plea might plead for justice there.
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
  That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes,
  And when the judge is robbed, the prisoner dies.

"O, teach me how to make mine own excuse,
Or, at the least, this refuge let me find:
Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse,
Immaculate and spotless is my mind;
That was not forced, that never was inclined
  To accessory yieldings, but still pure
  Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure."

Lo, here the hopeless merchant of this loss,
With head declined and voice dammed up with woe,
With sad set eyes and wreathed arms across,
From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow
The grief away that stops his answer so.
  But, wretched as he is, he strives in vain;
  What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.

As through an arch the violent roaring tide
Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
Back to the strait that forced him on so fast--
In rage sent out, recalled in rage, being past--
  Even so his sighs, his sorrows, make a saw
  To push grief on, and back the same grief draw,

Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth,
And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh:
"Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
Another power; no flood by raining slaketh.
My woe too sensible thy passion maketh
  More feeling-painful. Let it then suffice
  To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes.

"And for my sake when I might charm thee so,
For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:
Be suddenly revenged on my foe,
Thine, mine, his own. Suppose thou dost defend me
From what is past. The help that thou shalt lend me
  Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die,
  For sparing justice feeds iniquity.

"But ere I name him, you fair lords," quoth she,
Speaking to those that came with Collatine,
"Shall plight your honorable faiths to me
With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine,
For 'tis a meritorious fair design
  To chase injustice with revengeful arms.
  Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies' harms."

At this request, with noble disposition
Each present lord began to promise aid,
As bound in knighthood to her imposition,
Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed.
But she, that yet her sad task hath not said,
  The protestation stops: "O, speak," quoth she,
  "How may this forced stain be wiped from me?

"What is the quality of my offense,
Being constrained with dreadful circumstance?
May my pure mind with the foul act dispense,
My low-declined honor to advance?
May any terms acquit me from this chance?
  The poisoned fountain clears itself again,
  And why not I from this compelled stain?"

With this they all at once began to say
Her body's stain her mind untainted clears,
While with a joyless smile she turns away
The face, that map which deep impression bears
Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
  "No, no," quoth she, "no dame hereafter living
  By my excuse shall claim excuse's giving."

Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,
She throws forth Tarquin's name: "He, he," she says,
But more than "he" her poor tongue could not speak,
Till after many accents and delays,
Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,
  She utters this: "He, he, fair lords, 'tis he
  That guides this hand to give this wound to me."

Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed.

[Thunder and Lightning. Enter three Witches.]

When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

When the hurly-burly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.

That will be ere the set of sun.

Where the place?

SECOND WITCH  Upon the heath.

There to meet with Macbeth.

FIRST WITCH  I come, Graymalkin.

SECOND WITCH  Paddock calls.

THIRD WITCH  Anon.

Fair is foul, and foul is fair;
Hover through the fog and filthy air.


FIRST WITCH  Where hast thou been, sister?

SECOND WITCH  Killing swine.

THIRD WITCH  Sister, where thou?

A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap
And munched and munched and munched. "Give
me," quoth I.
"Aroint thee, witch," the rump-fed runnion cries.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' th' Tiger;
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

I'll give thee a wind.

Th' art kind.

And I another.

I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow;
All the quarters that they know
I' th' shipman's card.
I'll drain him dry as hay.
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his penthouse lid.
He shall live a man forbid.
Weary sev'nnights, nine times nine,
Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.
Though his bark cannot be lost,
Yet it shall be tempest-tossed.
Look what I have.

SECOND WITCH  Show me, show me.

Here I have a pilot's thumb,
Wracked as homeward he did come.	[Drum within.]

A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.

ALL, [dancing in a circle]
The Weird Sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about,
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace, the charm's wound up.

[Enter Macbeth and Banquo.]

So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

How far is 't called to Forres?--What are these,
So withered, and so wild in their attire,
That look not like th' inhabitants o' th' Earth
And yet are on 't?--Live you? Or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand
By each at once her choppy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.

MACBETH  Speak if you can. What are you?

All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!

All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!

All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!

Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair?--I' th' name of truth,
Are you fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly you show? My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
Speak, then, to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favors nor your hate.

FIRST WITCH  Hail!

SECOND WITCH  Hail!

THIRD WITCH  Hail!

Lesser than Macbeth and greater.

Not so happy, yet much happier.

Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!

Stay, you imperfect speakers. Tell me more.
By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis.
But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives
A prosperous gentleman, and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting. Speak, I charge you.
[Witches vanish.]

The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanished?

Into the air, and what seemed corporal melted,
As breath into the wind. Would they had stayed!

Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?

Your children shall be kings.

BANQUO  You shall be king.

And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?

To th' selfsame tune and words.--Who's here?


The King hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success, and, when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that,
In viewing o'er the rest o' th' selfsame day
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death. As thick as tale
Came post with post, and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,
And poured them down before him.

ANGUS  We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks,
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee.

And for an earnest of a greater honor,
He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor,
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,
For it is thine.

BANQUO  What, can the devil speak true?

The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me
In borrowed robes?

ANGUS  Who was the Thane lives yet,
But under heavy judgment bears that life
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was
combined
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
He labored in his country's wrack, I know not;
But treasons capital, confessed and proved,
Have overthrown him.

MACBETH, [aside]  Glamis and Thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus.] Thanks
for your pains.
[Aside to Banquo.] Do you not hope your children
shall be kings,
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them?

BANQUO  That, trusted home,
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange.
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles, to betray 's
In deepest consequence.--
Cousins, a word, I pray you.	[They step aside.]

MACBETH, [aside]  Two truths are told
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
[Aside.] This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success
Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
Against the use of nature? Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings.
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
Shakes so my single state of man
That function is smothered in surmise,
And nothing is but what is not.

BANQUO  Look how our partner's rapt.

If chance will have me king, why, chance may
crown me
Without my stir.

BANQUO  New honors come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mold
But with the aid of use.

MACBETH, [aside]  Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

Give me your favor. My dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are registered where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.
[Aside to Banquo.] Think upon what hath chanced,
and at more time,
The interim having weighed it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.

BANQUO  Very gladly.

MACBETH  Till then, enough.--Come, friends.

[Flourish. Enter King Duncan, Lennox, Malcolm,
Donalbain, and Attendants.]

Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet returned?

MALCOLM  My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die, who did report
That very frankly he confessed his treasons,
Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it. He died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed
As 'twere a careless trifle.

DUNCAN  There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face.
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.

[Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus.]

O worthiest cousin,
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay.

The service and the loyalty I owe
In doing it pays itself. Your Highness' part
Is to receive our duties, and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants,
Which do but what they should by doing everything
Safe toward your love and honor.

DUNCAN  Welcome hither.
I have begun to plant thee and will labor
To make thee full of growing.--Noble Banquo,
That hast no less deserved nor must be known
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
And hold thee to my heart.

BANQUO  There, if I grow,
The harvest is your own.

DUNCAN  My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow.--Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
On all deservers.--From hence to Inverness
And bind us further to you.

The rest is labor which is not used for you.
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach.
So humbly take my leave.

DUNCAN  My worthy Cawdor.

The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step
On which I must fall down or else o'erleap,
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
Let not light see my black and deep desires.
The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

True, worthy Banquo. He is full so valiant,
And in his commendations I am fed:
It is a banquet to me.--Let's after him,
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.
It is a peerless kinsman.



[Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.]

DOCTOR  I have two nights watched with you but can
perceive no truth in your report. When was it she
last walked?

GENTLEWOMAN  Since his Majesty went into the field, I
have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown
upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,
fold it, write upon 't, read it, afterwards seal it, and
again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast

DOCTOR  A great perturbation in nature, to receive at
once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of
watching. In this slumb'ry agitation, besides her
walking and other actual performances, what at any
time have you heard her say?

GENTLEWOMAN  That, sir, which I will not report after

DOCTOR  You may to me, and 'tis most meet you

GENTLEWOMAN  Neither to you nor anyone, having no
witness to confirm my speech.

[Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.]

Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise and,
upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

DOCTOR  How came she by that light?

GENTLEWOMAN  Why, it stood by her. She has light by
her continually. 'Tis her command.

DOCTOR  You see her eyes are open.

GENTLEWOMAN  Ay, but their sense are shut.

DOCTOR  What is it she does now? Look how she rubs
her hands.

GENTLEWOMAN  It is an accustomed action with her to
seem thus washing her hands. I have known her
continue in this a quarter of an hour.

LADY MACBETH  Yet here's a spot.

DOCTOR  Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes
from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more
strongly.

LADY MACBETH  Out, damned spot, out, I say! One. Two.
Why then, 'tis time to do 't. Hell is murky. Fie, my
lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear
who knows it, when none can call our power to
account? Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him?

DOCTOR  Do you mark that?

LADY MACBETH  The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is
she now? What, will these hands ne'er be clean? No
more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all
with this starting.

DOCTOR  Go to, go to. You have known what you should

GENTLEWOMAN  She has spoke what she should not,
I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has
known.

LADY MACBETH  Here's the smell of the blood still. All
the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. O, O, O!

DOCTOR  What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely
charged.

GENTLEWOMAN  I would not have such a heart in my
bosom for the dignity of the whole body.

DOCTOR  Well, well, well.

GENTLEWOMAN  Pray God it be, sir.

DOCTOR  This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have
known those which have walked in their sleep,
who have died holily in their beds.

LADY MACBETH  Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown.
Look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo's
buried; he cannot come out on 's grave.

DOCTOR  Even so?

LADY MACBETH  To bed, to bed. There's knocking at the
gate. Come, come, come, come. Give me your
hand. What's done cannot be undone. To bed, to
bed, to bed.	[Lady Macbeth exits.]

DOCTOR  Will she go now to bed?

GENTLEWOMAN  Directly.

Foul whisp'rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all. Look after her.
Remove from her the means of all annoyance
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night.
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think but dare not speak.

GENTLEWOMAN  Good night, good doctor.

[Drum and Colors. Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff, and
their army, with boughs.]

Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down
And show like those you are.--You, worthy uncle,
Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,
Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
According to our order.

SIWARD  Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight,
Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.

Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
[Alarums continued.]

[Enter Elbow, Pompey, and Officers.]

ELBOW, [to Pompey]  Nay, if there be no remedy for it
but that you will needs buy and sell men and
women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink
brown and white bastard.

DUKE, [as Friar, aside]  O heavens, what stuff is here?

POMPEY  'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries,
the merriest was put down, and the worser allowed
by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm,
and furred with fox and lambskins too, to signify
that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for
the facing.

ELBOW  Come your way, sir.--Bless you, good father
friar.

DUKE, [as Friar]  And you, good brother father. What
offense hath this man made you, sir?

ELBOW  Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir,
we take him to be a thief too, sir, for we have found
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
sent to the Deputy.

DUKE, [as Friar, to Pompey]
Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice; say to thyself,
From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY  Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir. But yet,
sir, I would prove--

Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his.--Take him to prison, officer.
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW  He must before the Deputy, sir; he has given
him warning. The Deputy cannot abide a whoremaster.
If he be a whoremonger and comes before
him, he were as good go a mile on his errand.

That we were all, as some would seem to be,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free.

ELBOW  His neck will come to your waist--a cord, sir.


POMPEY  I spy comfort, I cry bail. Here's a gentleman
and a friend of mine.

LUCIO  How now, noble Pompey? What, at the wheels of
Caesar? Art thou led in triumph? What, is there
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman,
to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket
and extracting it clutched? What reply, ha? What
sayst thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is 't not
drowned i' th' last rain, ha? What sayst thou, trot? Is
the world as it was, man? Which is the way? Is it sad
and few words? Or how? The trick of it?

DUKE, [as Friar, aside]  Still thus, and thus; still worse.

LUCIO, [to Pompey]  How doth my dear morsel, thy
mistress? Procures she still, ha?

POMPEY  Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and
she is herself in the tub.

LUCIO  Why, 'tis good. It is the right of it. It must be so.
Ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd, an
unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going to
prison, Pompey?

POMPEY  Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO  Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell. Go say I
sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? Or how?

ELBOW  For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO  Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be
the due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right. Bawd is he,
doubtless, and of antiquity too. Bawd born.--
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
Pompey. You will turn good husband now,
Pompey; you will keep the house.

POMPEY  I hope, sir, your good Worship will be my bail.

LUCIO  No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the
wear. I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage.
If you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is
the more. Adieu, trusty Pompey.--Bless you, friar.

DUKE, [as Friar]  And you.

LUCIO, [to Pompey]  Does Bridget paint still, Pompey,
ha?

ELBOW, [to Pompey]  Come your ways, sir, come.

POMPEY, [to Lucio]  You will not bail me, then, sir?

LUCIO  Then, Pompey, nor now.--What news abroad,
friar? What news?

ELBOW, [to Pompey]  Come your ways, sir, come.

LUCIO  Go to kennel, Pompey, go.
[Elbow, Pompey, and Officers exit.]
What news, friar, of the Duke?

DUKE, [as Friar]  I know none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO  Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia;
other some, he is in Rome. But where is he, think

DUKE, [as Friar]  I know not where, but wheresoever, I
wish him well.

LUCIO  It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal
from the state and usurp the beggary he was never
born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence.
He puts transgression to 't.

DUKE, [as Friar]  He does well in 't.

LUCIO  A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm
in him. Something too crabbed that way, friar.

DUKE, [as Friar]  It is too general a vice, and severity
must cure it.

LUCIO  Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
it is well allied, but it is impossible to extirp it quite,
friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say
this Angelo was not made by man and woman after
this downright way of creation. Is it true, think

DUKE, [as Friar]  How should he be made, then?

LUCIO  Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some,
that he was begot between two stockfishes. But it is
certain that when he makes water, his urine is
congealed ice; that I know to be true. And he is a
motion generative, that's infallible.

DUKE, [as Friar]  You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

LUCIO  Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting
a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the
nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the
sport, he knew the service, and that instructed him
to mercy.

DUKE, [as Friar]  I never heard the absent duke much
detected for women. He was not inclined that way.

LUCIO  O, sir, you are deceived.

DUKE, [as Friar]  'Tis not possible.

LUCIO  Who, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty;
and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The
Duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too,
that let me inform you.

DUKE, [as Friar]  You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO  Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
Duke, and I believe I know the cause of his
withdrawing.

DUKE, [as Friar]  What, I prithee, might be the cause?

LUCIO  No, pardon. 'Tis a secret must be locked within
the teeth and the lips. But this I can let you
understand: the greater file of the subject held the
Duke to be wise.

DUKE, [as Friar]  Wise? Why, no question but he was.

LUCIO  A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE, [as Friar]  Either this is envy in you, folly, or
mistaking. The very stream of his life and the
business he hath helmed must, upon a warranted
need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be
but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he
shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman,
and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskillfully. Or,
if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in
your malice.

LUCIO  Sir, I know him, and I love him.

DUKE, [as Friar]  Love talks with better knowledge, and
knowledge with dearer love.

LUCIO  Come, sir, I know what I know.

DUKE, [as Friar]  I can hardly believe that, since you
know not what you speak. But if ever the Duke
return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you
to make your answer before him. If it be honest you
have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am
bound to call upon you, and, I pray you, your name?

LUCIO  Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.

DUKE, [as Friar]  He shall know you better, sir, if I may
live to report you.

LUCIO  I fear you not.

DUKE, [as Friar]  O, you hope the Duke will return no
more, or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite.
But indeed I can do you little harm; you'll
forswear this again.

LUCIO  I'll be hanged first. Thou art deceived in me,
friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio
die tomorrow or no?

DUKE, [as Friar]  Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO  Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
the Duke we talk of were returned again. This
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
continency. Sparrows must not build in his house
eaves, because they are lecherous. The Duke yet
would have dark deeds darkly answered. He would
never bring them to light Would he were returned.
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
Farewell, good friar. I prithee pray for me. The
Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's now past it, yet--and I say to thee--
he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt
brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.

No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure scape. Back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?

[Enter Escalus, Provost, Officers, and Mistress
Overdone, a Bawd.]

ESCALUS, [to Officers]  Go, away with her to prison.

BAWD  Good my lord, be good to me. Your Honor is
accounted a merciful man, good my lord.

ESCALUS  Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit
in the same kind? This would make mercy
swear and play the tyrant.

PROVOST  A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it
please your Honor.

BAWD, [to Escalus]  My lord, this is one Lucio's information
against me. Mistress Kate Keepdown was
with child by him in the Duke's time; he promised
her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old
come Philip and Jacob. I have kept it myself, and see
how he goes about to abuse me.

ESCALUS  That fellow is a fellow of much license. Let
him be called before us. Away with her to prison.--
Go to, no more words.	[Officers exit with Bawd.]
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered.
Claudio must die tomorrow. Let him be furnished
with divines and have all charitable preparation. If
my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be so
with him.

PROVOST  So please you, this friar hath been with him,
and advised him for th' entertainment of death.

ESCALUS  Good even, good father.

DUKE, [as Friar]  Bliss and goodness on you.

ESCALUS  Of whence are you?

Not of this country, though my chance is now
To use it for my time. I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from the See
In special business from his Holiness.

ESCALUS  What news abroad i' th' world?

DUKE, [as Friar]  None but that there is so great a fever
on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it.
Novelty is only in request, and it is as dangerous to
be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be
constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth
enough alive to make societies secure, but security
enough to make fellowships accursed. Much upon
this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news
is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I pray you,
sir, of what disposition was the Duke?

ESCALUS  One that, above all other strifes, contended
especially to know himself.

DUKE, [as Friar]  What pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS  Rather rejoicing to see another merry than
merry at anything which professed to make him
rejoice--a gentleman of all temperance. But leave
we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove
prosperous, and let me desire to know how you find
Claudio prepared. I am made to understand that
you have lent him visitation.

DUKE, [as Friar]  He professes to have received no
sinister measure from his judge but most willingly
humbles himself to the determination of justice. Yet
had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his
frailty, many deceiving promises of life, which I, by
my good leisure, have discredited to him, and now
is he resolved to die.

ESCALUS  You have paid the heavens your function and
the prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
labored for the poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty, but my brother justice have I
found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE, [as Friar]  If his own life answer the straitness of
his proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if
he chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUS  I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE, [as Friar]  Peace be with you.
[Escalus and Provost exit.]

He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe,
Pattern in himself to know,
Grace to stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to others paying
Than by self-offenses weighing.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking.
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice, and let his grow.
O, what may man within him hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practice on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and substantial things.
Craft against vice I must apply.
With Angelo tonight shall lie
His old betrothed but despised.
So disguise shall, by th' disguised,
Pay with falsehood false exacting
And perform an old contracting.

[Enter Sir John the Bastard, and Conrade, his
companion.]

CONRADE  What the goodyear, my lord, why are you
thus out of measure sad?

DON JOHN  There is no measure in the occasion that
breeds. Therefore the sadness is without limit.

CONRADE  You should hear reason.

DON JOHN  And when I have heard it, what blessing
brings it?

CONRADE  If not a present remedy, at least a patient
sufferance.

DON JOHN  I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayst thou
art, born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
what I am. I must be sad when I have cause, and
smile at no man's jests; eat when I have stomach,
and wait for no man's leisure; sleep when I am
drowsy, and tend on no man's business; laugh when
I am merry, and claw no man in his humor.

CONRADE  Yea, but you must not make the full show of
this till you may do it without controlment. You
have of late stood out against your brother, and he
hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where it is
impossible you should take true root but by the fair
weather that you make yourself. It is needful that
you frame the season for your own harvest.

DON JOHN  I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a
rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
love from any. In this, though I cannot be said to be
a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I
am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a
muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
my liking. In the meantime, let me be that I am, and
seek not to alter me.

CONRADE  Can you make no use of your discontent?

DON JOHN  I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who
comes here?

[Enter Borachio.]

What news, Borachio?

BORACHIO  I came yonder from a great supper. The
Prince your brother is royally entertained by
Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an
intended marriage.

DON JOHN  Will it serve for any model to build mischief
on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
unquietness?

BORACHIO  Marry, it is your brother's right hand.

DON JOHN  Who, the most exquisite Claudio?

BORACHIO  Even he.

DON JOHN  A proper squire. And who, and who? Which
way looks he?

BORACHIO  Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of

DON JOHN  A very forward March chick! How came you
to this?

BORACHIO  Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was
smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and
Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference. I
whipped me behind the arras, and there heard it
agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for
himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count

DON JOHN  Come, come, let us thither. This may prove
food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath
all the glory of my overthrow. If I can cross him any
way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and
will assist me?

CONRADE  To the death, my lord.

DON JOHN  Let us to the great supper. Their cheer is the
greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were o'
my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?

BORACHIO  We'll wait upon your Lordship.

[Enter Prince, Claudio, Benedick, and Leonato.]

PRINCE  I do but stay till your marriage be consummate,
and then go I toward Aragon.

CLAUDIO  I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll vouchsafe

PRINCE  Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new
gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new
coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
with Benedick for his company, for from the crown
of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth. He
hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bowstring, and the
little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a
heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the
clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue
speaks.

BENEDICK  Gallants, I am not as I have been.

LEONATO  So say I. Methinks you are sadder.

CLAUDIO  I hope he be in love.

PRINCE  Hang him, truant! There's no true drop of
blood in him to be truly touched with love. If he be
sad, he wants money.

BENEDICK  I have the toothache.

PRINCE  Draw it.

BENEDICK  Hang it!

CLAUDIO  You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.

PRINCE  What, sigh for the toothache?

LEONATO  Where is but a humor or a worm.

BENEDICK  Well, everyone can master a grief but he
that has it.

CLAUDIO  Yet say I, he is in love.

PRINCE  There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless
it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to
be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow, or
in the shape of two countries at once, as a German
from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard
from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a
fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.

CLAUDIO  If he be not in love with some woman, there
is no believing old signs. He brushes his hat o'
mornings. What should that bode?

PRINCE  Hath any man seen him at the barber's?

CLAUDIO  No, but the barber's man hath been seen
with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath
already stuffed tennis balls.

LEONATO  Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the
loss of a beard.

PRINCE  Nay, he rubs himself with civet. Can you smell
him out by that?

CLAUDIO  That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in

PRINCE  The greatest note of it is his melancholy.

CLAUDIO  And when was he wont to wash his face?

PRINCE  Yea, or to paint himself? For the which I hear
what they say of him.

CLAUDIO  Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept
into a lute string and now governed by stops--

PRINCE  Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude,
conclude, he is in love.

CLAUDIO  Nay, but I know who loves him.

PRINCE  That would I know, too. I warrant, one that
knows him not.

CLAUDIO  Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
all, dies for him.

PRINCE  She shall be buried with her face upwards.

BENEDICK  Yet is this no charm for the toothache.--
Old signior, walk aside with me. I have studied eight
or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
hobby-horses must not hear.
[Benedick and Leonato exit.]

PRINCE  For my life, to break with him about Beatrice!

CLAUDIO  'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this
played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two
bears will not bite one another when they meet.

[Enter John the Bastard.]

DON JOHN  My lord and brother, God save you.

PRINCE  Good e'en, brother.

DON JOHN  If your leisure served, I would speak with

PRINCE  In private?

DON JOHN  If it please you. Yet Count Claudio may
hear, for what I would speak of concerns him.


DON JOHN, [to Claudio]  Means your Lordship to be
married tomorrow?

PRINCE  You know he does.

DON JOHN  I know not that, when he knows what I

CLAUDIO  If there be any impediment, I pray you discover

DON JOHN  You may think I love you not. Let that
appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I
now will manifest. For my brother, I think he holds
you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
your ensuing marriage--surely suit ill spent and
labor ill bestowed.

PRINCE  Why, what's the matter?

DON JOHN  I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
shortened, for she has been too long
a-talking of, the lady is disloyal.

CLAUDIO  Who, Hero?

DON JOHN  Even she: Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every
man's Hero.

CLAUDIO  Disloyal?

DON JOHN  The word is too good to paint out her
wickedness. I could say she were worse. Think you
of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not
till further warrant. Go but with me tonight, you
shall see her chamber window entered, even the
night before her wedding day. If you love her then,
tomorrow wed her. But it would better fit your
honor to change your mind.

CLAUDIO, [to Prince]  May this be so?

PRINCE  I will not think it.

DON JOHN  If you dare not trust that you see, confess
not that you know. If you will follow me, I will
show you enough, and when you have seen more
and heard more, proceed accordingly.

CLAUDIO  If I see anything tonight why I should not
marry her, tomorrow in the congregation, where I
should wed, there will I shame her.

PRINCE  And as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will
join with thee to disgrace her.

DON JOHN  I will disparage her no farther till you are
my witnesses. Bear it coldly but till midnight, and
let the issue show itself.

PRINCE  O day untowardly turned!

CLAUDIO  O mischief strangely thwarting!

DON JOHN  O plague right well prevented! So will you
say when you have seen the sequel.

[Enter the Constables Dogberry and Verges, and the
Town Clerk, or Sexton, in gowns, with the Watch,
Conrade, and Borachio.]

DOGBERRY  Is our whole dissembly appeared?

VERGES  O, a stool and a cushion for the Sexton.
[A stool is brought in; the Sexton sits.]

SEXTON  Which be the malefactors?

DOGBERRY  Marry, that am I, and my partner.

VERGES  Nay, that's certain, we have the exhibition to
examine.

SEXTON  But which are the offenders that are to be
examined? Let them come before Master
Constable.

DOGBERRY  Yea, marry, let them come before me.
[Conrade and Borachio are brought forward.]
What is your name, friend?

BORACHIO  Borachio.

DOGBERRY  Pray, write down "Borachio."--Yours,

CONRADE  I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is
Conrade.

DOGBERRY  Write down "Master Gentleman Conrade."--
Masters, do you serve God?

BORACHIO/CONRADE  Yea, sir, we hope.

DOGBERRY  Write down that they hope they serve
God; and write God first, for God defend but God
should go before such villains!--Masters, it is
proved already that you are little better than false
knaves, and it will go near to be thought so shortly.
How answer you for yourselves?

CONRADE  Marry, sir, we say we are none.

DOGBERRY  A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you,
but I will go about with him.--Come you hither,
sirrah, a word in your ear. Sir, I say to you it is
thought you are false knaves.

BORACHIO  Sir, I say to you we are none.

DOGBERRY  Well, stand aside.--'Fore God, they are
both in a tale. Have you writ down that they are
none?

SEXTON  Master constable, you go not the way to
examine. You must call forth the watch that are
their accusers.

DOGBERRY  Yea, marry, that's the eftest way.--Let
the watch come forth. Masters, I charge you in the
Prince's name, accuse these men.

FIRST WATCHMAN  This man said, sir, that Don John, the
Prince's brother, was a villain.

DOGBERRY  Write down Prince John a villain. Why,
this is flat perjury, to call a prince's brother villain!

BORACHIO  Master constable--

DOGBERRY  Pray thee, fellow, peace. I do not like thy
look, I promise thee.

SEXTON, [to Watch]  What heard you him say else?

SEACOAL  Marry, that he had received a thousand
ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero
wrongfully.

DOGBERRY  Flat burglary as ever was committed.

VERGES  Yea, by Mass, that it is.

SEXTON  What else, fellow?

FIRST WATCHMAN  And that Count Claudio did mean,
upon his words, to disgrace Hero before the whole
assembly, and not marry her.

DOGBERRY, [to Borachio]  O, villain! Thou wilt be condemned
into everlasting redemption for this!

SEXTON  What else?

SEACOAL  This is all.

SEXTON  And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away.
Hero was in this manner accused, in this very
manner refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly
died.--Master constable, let these men be bound
and brought to Leonato's. I will go before and show
him their examination.	[He exits.]

DOGBERRY  Come, let them be opinioned.

VERGES  Let them be in the hands--

CONRADE  Off, coxcomb!

DOGBERRY  God's my life, where's the Sexton? Let
him write down the Prince's officer "coxcomb."
Come, bind them.--Thou naughty varlet!

CONRADE  Away! You are an ass, you are an ass!

DOGBERRY  Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost
thou not suspect my years? O, that he were here to
write me down an ass! But masters, remember that
I am an ass, though it be not written down, yet
forget not that I am an ass.--No, thou villain, thou
art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by
good witness. I am a wise fellow and, which is more,
an officer and, which is more, a householder and,
which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
Messina, and one that knows the law, go to, and a
rich fellow enough, go to, and a fellow that hath had
losses, and one that hath two gowns and everything
handsome about him.--Bring him away.--O, that I
had been writ down an ass!

[Enter Othello's Herald with a proclamation.]

HERALD  It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant
general, that upon certain tidings now arrived,
importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,
every man put himself into triumph: some to
dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what
sport and revels his addition leads him. For besides
these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his
nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed
All offices are open, and there is full
liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till
the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of
Cyprus and our noble general, Othello!

[Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.]

Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.
Let's teach ourselves that honorable stop
Not to outsport discretion.

Iago hath direction what to do,
But notwithstanding, with my personal eye
Will I look to 't.

OTHELLO  Iago is most honest.
Michael, goodnight. Tomorrow with your earliest
Let me have speech with you. [To Desdemona.] Come,
my dear love,
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.--
[Othello and Desdemona exit, with Attendants.]


Welcome, Iago. We must to the watch.

IAGO  Not this hour, lieutenant. 'Tis not yet ten o' th'
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of
his Desdemona--who let us not therefore blame;
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and
she is sport for Jove.

CASSIO  She's a most exquisite lady.

IAGO  And, I'll warrant her, full of game.

CASSIO  Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate

IAGO  What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley
to provocation.

CASSIO  An inviting eye, and yet methinks right
modest.

IAGO  And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?

CASSIO  She is indeed perfection.

IAGO  Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant,
I have a stoup of wine; and here without are a
brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a
measure to the health of black Othello.

CASSIO  Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of

IAGO  O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink

CASSIO  I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was
craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it
makes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity and
dare not task my weakness with any more.

IAGO  What, man! 'Tis a night of revels. The gallants
desire it.

CASSIO  Where are they?

IAGO  Here at the door. I pray you, call them in.

CASSIO  I'll do 't, but it dislikes me.	[He exits.]

If I can fasten but one cup upon him
With that which he hath drunk tonight already,
He'll be as full of quarrel and offense
As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool
Roderigo,
Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,
To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
Three else of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits
That hold their honors in a wary distance,
The very elements of this warlike isle,
Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups;
And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of
drunkards
Am I to put our Cassio in some action
That may offend the isle. But here they come.
If consequence do but approve my dream,
My boat sails freely both with wind and stream.

[Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen, followed by
Servants with wine.]

CASSIO  'Fore God, they have given me a rouse
already.

MONTANO  Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I
am a soldier.

IAGO  Some wine, ho!
[Sings.]	And let me the cannikin clink, clink,
	And let me the cannikin clink.
	   A soldier's a man,
	   O, man's life's but a span,
	Why, then, let a soldier drink.
Some wine, boys!

CASSIO  'Fore God, an excellent song.

IAGO  I learned it in England, where indeed they are
most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German,
and your swag-bellied Hollander--drink, ho!--are
nothing to your English.

CASSIO  Is your Englishman so exquisite in his
drinking?

IAGO  Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane
dead drunk. He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.
He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next
pottle can be filled.

CASSIO  To the health of our general!

MONTANO  I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you

IAGO  O sweet England!
[Sings.]	King Stephen was and-a worthy peer,
	   His breeches cost him but a crown;
	He held them sixpence all too dear;
	   With that he called the tailor lown.
	He was a wight of high renown,
	   And thou art but of low degree;
	'Tis pride that pulls the country down,
	   Then take thy auld cloak about thee.
Some wine, ho!

CASSIO  'Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than
the other!

IAGO  Will you hear 't again?

CASSIO  No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place
that does those things. Well, God's above all; and
there be souls must be saved, and there be souls
must not be saved.

IAGO  It's true, good lieutenant.

CASSIO  For mine own part--no offense to the General,
nor any man of quality--I hope to be saved.

IAGO  And so do I too, lieutenant.

CASSIO  Ay, but, by your leave, not before me. The
Lieutenant is to be saved before the Ancient. Let's
have no more of this. Let's to our affairs. God
forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let's look to our
business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This
is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my
left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough,
and I speak well enough.

GENTLEMEN  Excellent well.

CASSIO  Why, very well then. You must not think then
that I am drunk.	[He exits.]

To th' platform, masters. Come, let's set the watch.
[Gentlemen exit.]

IAGO, [to Montano]
You see this fellow that is gone before?
He's a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
And give direction; and do but see his vice.
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
The one as long as th' other. 'Tis pity of him.
I fear the trust Othello puts him in,
On some odd time of his infirmity,
Will shake this island.

MONTANO  But is he often thus?

'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.
He'll watch the horologe a double set
If drink rock not his cradle.

MONTANO  It were well
The General were put in mind of it.
Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?

[Enter Roderigo.]

IAGO, [aside to Roderigo]  How now, Roderigo?
I pray you, after the Lieutenant, go.
[Roderigo exits.]

And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
Should hazard such a place as his own second
With one of an engraffed infirmity.
It were an honest action to say so
To the Moor.

IAGO  Not I, for this fair island.
I do love Cassio well and would do much
To cure him of this evil--	["Help, help!" within.]
But hark! What noise?

[Enter Cassio, pursuing Roderigo.]

CASSIO  Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!

MONTANO  What's the matter, lieutenant?

CASSIO  A knave teach me my duty? I'll beat the knave
into a twiggen bottle.

RODERIGO  Beat me?

CASSIO  Dost thou prate, rogue?	[He hits Roderigo.]

MONTANO  Nay, good lieutenant. I pray you, sir, hold

CASSIO  Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the
mazard.

MONTANO  Come, come, you're drunk.

CASSIO  Drunk?
[They fight.]

IAGO, [aside to Roderigo]
Away, I say! Go out and cry a mutiny.
[Roderigo exits.]
Nay, good lieutenant.--God's will, gentlemen!--
Help, ho! Lieutenant--sir--Montano--sir--
Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!
[A bell is rung.]
Who's that which rings the bell? Diablo, ho!
The town will rise. God's will, lieutenant, hold!
You will be shamed forever.


What is the matter here?

MONTANO  Zounds, I bleed
I am hurt to th' death. He dies!	[He attacks Cassio.]

OTHELLO  Hold, for your lives!

Hold, ho! Lieutenant--sir--Montano--
gentlemen--
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
Hold! The General speaks to you. Hold, for shame!

Why, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?
Are we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl!
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
Silence that dreadful bell. It frights the isle
From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,
Speak. Who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.

I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,
In quarter and in terms like bride and groom
Divesting them for bed; and then but now,
As if some planet had unwitted men,
Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
Any beginning to this peevish odds,
And would in action glorious I had lost
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!

How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

I pray you pardon me; I cannot speak.

Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted. And your name is great
In mouths of wisest censure. What's the matter
That you unlace your reputation thus,
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.

Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.
Your officer Iago can inform you,
While I spare speech, which something now offends
Of all that I do know; nor know I aught
By me that's said or done amiss this night,
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us.

OTHELLO  Now, by heaven,
My blood begins my safer guides to rule,
And passion, having my best judgment collied,
Assays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
How this foul rout began, who set it on;
And he that is approved in this offense,
Though he had twinned with me, both at a birth,
Shall lose me. What, in a town of war
Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
To manage private and domestic quarrel,
In night, and on the court and guard of safety?
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began 't?

If partially affined, or leagued in office,
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
Thou art no soldier.

IAGO  Touch me not so near.
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio.
Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:
Montano and myself being in speech,
There comes a fellow crying out for help,
And Cassio following him with determined sword
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
[Pointing to Montano.]
Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
Lest by his clamor--as it so fell out--
The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,
Outran my purpose, and I returned the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords
And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight
I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
For this was brief--I found them close together
At blow and thrust, even as again they were
When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report.
But men are men; the best sometimes forget.
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
From him that fled some strange indignity
Which patience could not pass.

OTHELLO  I know, Iago,
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
Making it light to Cassio.--Cassio, I love thee,
But nevermore be officer of mine.

[Enter Desdemona attended.]

Look if my gentle love be not raised up!
I'll make thee an example.

What is the matter, dear?

OTHELLO  All's well now,
sweeting.
Come away to bed. [To Montano.] Sir, for your hurts,
Myself will be your surgeon.--Lead him off.
[Montano is led off.]
Iago, look with care about the town
And silence those whom this vile brawl
distracted.--
Come, Desdemona. 'Tis the soldier's life
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
[All but Iago and Cassio exit.]

IAGO  What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

CASSIO  Ay, past all surgery.

IAGO  Marry, God forbid!

CASSIO  Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have
lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
Iago, my reputation!

IAGO  As I am an honest man, I thought you had
received some bodily wound. There is more sense
in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and
most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost
without deserving. You have lost no reputation at
all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What,
man, there are ways to recover the General again!
You are but now cast in his mood--a punishment
more in policy than in malice, even so as one would
beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious
lion. Sue to him again and he's yours.

CASSIO  I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive
so good a commander with so slight, so drunken,
and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak
parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse
fustian with one's own shadow? O thou
invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be
known by, let us call thee devil!

IAGO  What was he that you followed with your sword?
What had he done to you?

CASSIO  I know not.

IAGO  Is 't possible?

CASSIO  I remember a mass of things, but nothing
distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O
God, that men should put an enemy in their
mouths to steal away their brains! That we should
with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause transform
ourselves into beasts!

IAGO  Why, but you are now well enough. How came
you thus recovered?

CASSIO  It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give
place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows
me another, to make me frankly despise myself.

IAGO  Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time,
the place, and the condition of this country stands,
I could heartily wish this had not so befallen. But
since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.

CASSIO  I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell
me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as
Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be
now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently
a beast! O, strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed,
and the ingredient is a devil.

IAGO  Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it.
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

CASSIO  I have well approved it, sir.--I drunk!

IAGO  You or any man living may be drunk at a time,
man. I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's
wife is now the general: I may say so in this
respect, for that he hath devoted and given up
himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement
of her parts and graces. Confess yourself
freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your
place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so
blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her
goodness not to do more than she is requested. This
broken joint between you and her husband entreat
her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay
worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow
stronger than it was before.

CASSIO  You advise me well.

IAGO  I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest

CASSIO  I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I
will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake
for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check
me here.

IAGO  You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant. I
must to the watch.

CASSIO  Good night, honest Iago.	[Cassio exits.]

And what's he, then, that says I play the villain,
When this advice is free I give and honest,
Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
Th' inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful
As the free elements. And then for her
To win the Moor--were 't to renounce his baptism,
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin--
His soul is so enfettered to her love
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function. How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
When devils will the blackest sins put on,
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
As I do now. For whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear:
That she repeals him for her body's lust;
And by how much she strives to do him good,
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all.

[Enter Roderigo.]

How now, Roderigo?

RODERIGO  I do follow here in the chase, not like a
hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My
money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly
well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I
shall have so much experience for my pains, and so,
with no money at all and a little more wit, return
again to Venice.

How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does 't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashiered Cassio.
Though other things grow fair against the sun,
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
Content thyself awhile. By th' Mass, 'tis morning!
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
Away, I say! Thou shalt know more hereafter.
Nay, get thee gone.	[Roderigo exits.]
Two things are to be done.
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.
I'll set her on.
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way.
Dull not device by coldness and delay.


[Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.]

These letters give, Iago, to the pilot
And by him do my duties to the Senate.
[He gives Iago some papers.]
That done, I will be walking on the works.
Repair there to me.

IAGO  Well, my good lord, I'll do 't.

This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see 't?

GENTLEMEN
We wait upon your Lordship.


[Enter Othello and Emilia.]

OTHELLO  You have seen nothing then?

Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them.

What, did they never whisper?

EMILIA  Never, my lord.

OTHELLO  Nor send you out o' th' way?

EMILIA  Never.

To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

EMILIA  Never, my lord.

OTHELLO  That's strange.

I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other,
Remove your thought. It doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse,
For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
There's no man happy. The purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.

OTHELLO  Bid her come hither. Go.
[Emilia exits.]
She says enough. Yet she's a simple bawd
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
And yet she'll kneel and pray. I have seen her do 't.


DESDEMONA  My lord, what is your will?

Pray you, chuck, come hither.

DESDEMONA  What is your
pleasure?

Let me see your eyes. Look in my face.

DESDEMONA  What horrible fancy's this?

OTHELLO, [to Emilia]  Some of your function,
Leave procreants alone, and shut the door.
Cough, or cry "hem," if anybody come.
Your mystery, your mystery! Nay, dispatch.
[Emilia exits.]

DESDEMONA, [kneeling]
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words,
But not the words.

OTHELLO  Why? What art thou?

Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.

OTHELLO  Come, swear it. Damn thyself,
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double
damned.
Swear thou art honest.

DESDEMONA  Heaven doth truly know it.

Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

DESDEMONA, [standing]
To whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false?

Ah, Desdemon, away, away, away!

Alas the heavy day, why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,
I have lost him too.

OTHELLO  Had it pleased heaven
To try me with affliction, had they rained
All kind of sores and shames on my bare head,
Steeped me in poverty to the very lips,
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
I should have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience. But alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at--
Yet could I bear that too, well, very well.
But there where I have garnered up my heart,
Where either I must live or bear no life,
The fountain from the which my current runs
Or else dries up--to be discarded thence,
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in--turn thy complexion there,
Patience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin,
Ay, there look grim as hell.

I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,
That quicken even with blowing! O thou weed,
Who art so lovely fair, and smell'st so sweet
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst
ne'er been born!

Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
Made to write "whore" upon? What committed?
Committed? O thou public commoner,
I should make very forges of my cheeks
That would to cinders burn up modesty,
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed?
Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
Is hushed within the hollow mine of earth
And will not hear 't. What committed?
Impudent strumpet!

DESDEMONA  By heaven, you do me wrong!

OTHELLO  Are not you a strumpet?

DESDEMONA  No, as I am a Christian!
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

OTHELLO  What, not a whore?

DESDEMONA  No, as I shall be saved.

OTHELLO  Is 't possible?

O, heaven forgive us!

OTHELLO  I cry you mercy, then.
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello.--You, mistress,


That have the office opposite to Saint Peter
And keeps the gate of hell--you, you, ay, you!
We have done our course. There's money for your
pains.	[He gives her money.]
I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel.

Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?

DESDEMONA  Faith, half asleep.

Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

DESDEMONA  With who?

EMILIA  Why, with my lord, madam.

Who is thy lord?

EMILIA  He that is yours, sweet lady.

I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia.
I cannot weep, nor answers have I none
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember.
And call thy husband hither.

EMILIA  Here's a change indeed.	[She exits.]

'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved that he might stick
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?

[Enter Iago and Emilia.]

What is your pleasure, madam? How is 't with you?

I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.
He might have chid me so, for, in good faith,
I am a child to chiding.

IAGO  What is the matter, lady?

Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
As true hearts cannot bear.

Am I that name, Iago?

IAGO  What name, fair

Such as she said my lord did say I was.

He called her "whore." A beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.

IAGO  Why did he so?

I do not know. I am sure I am none such.

Do not weep, do not weep! Alas the day!

Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
Her father and her country and her friends,
To be called "whore"? Would it not make one

DESDEMONA  It is my wretched fortune.

Beshrew him for 't! How comes this trick upon him?

DESDEMONA  Nay, heaven doth know.

I will be hanged if some eternal villain,
Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Have not devised this slander. I will be hanged else.

Fie, there is no such man. It is impossible.

If any such there be, heaven pardon him.

A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her "whore"? Who keeps her
company?
What place? What time? What form? What
likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave,
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou 'dst unfold,
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world,
Even from the east to th' west!

IAGO  Speak within door.

O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
That turned your wit the seamy side without
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

You are a fool. Go to!

DESDEMONA  Alas, Iago,
What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him. [She kneels.] Here I
kneel.
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense
Delighted them in any other form,
Or that I do not yet, and ever did,
And ever will--though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,
Comfort forswear me! [She stands.] Unkindness may
do much,
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
But never taint my love. I cannot say "whore"--
It does abhor me now I speak the word.
To do the act that might the addition earn,
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

I pray you be content. 'Tis but his humor.
The business of the state does him offense,
And he does chide with you.

If 'twere no other--

IAGO  It is but so, I warrant.
[Trumpets sound.]
Hark how these instruments summon to supper.
The messengers of Venice stays the meat.
Go in and weep not. All things shall be well.

[Enter Roderigo.]

How now, Roderigo?

RODERIGO  I do not find
That thou deal'st justly with me.

IAGO  What in the contrary?

RODERIGO  Every day thou daff'st me with some device,
Iago, and rather, as it seems to me now,
keep'st from me all conveniency than suppliest me
with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no
longer endure it. Nor am I yet persuaded to put up
in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.

IAGO  Will you hear me, Roderigo?

RODERIGO  Faith, I have heard too much, and your
words and performances are no kin together.

IAGO  You charge me most unjustly.

RODERIGO  With naught but truth. I have wasted myself
out of my means. The jewels you have had
from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have
corrupted a votaress. You have told me she hath
received them, and returned me expectations and
comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I
find none.

IAGO  Well, go to! Very well.

RODERIGO  "Very well." "Go to!" I cannot go to, man,
nor 'tis not very well! By this hand, I say 'tis very
scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.

IAGO  Very well.

RODERIGO  I tell you 'tis not very well! I will make
myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me
my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
unlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will
seek satisfaction of you.

IAGO  You have said now.

RODERIGO  Ay, and said nothing but what I protest
intendment of doing.

IAGO  Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even
from this instant do build on thee a better opinion
than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo.
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception,
but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy

RODERIGO  It hath not appeared.

IAGO  I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed which I
have greater reason to believe now than ever--I
mean purpose, courage, and valor--this night show
it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
take me from this world with treachery and
devise engines for my life.

RODERIGO  Well, what is it? Is it within reason and
compass?

IAGO  Sir, there is especial commission come from
Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place.

RODERIGO  Is that true? Why, then, Othello and Desdemona
return again to Venice.

IAGO  O, no. He goes into Mauritania and takes away
with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
lingered here by some accident--wherein none
can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.

RODERIGO  How do you mean, removing him?

IAGO  Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's
place: knocking out his brains.

RODERIGO  And that you would have me to do?

IAGO  Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He
sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to
him. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If
you will watch his going thence (which I will
fashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may
take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second
your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come,
stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will
show you such a necessity in his death that you shall
think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high
supper time, and the night grows to waste. About it!

RODERIGO  I will hear further reason for this.

IAGO  And you shall be satisfied.

[Enter the King Simonides, Thaisa, Marshal, Ladies,
Lords, Attendants, and Knights in armor, from tilting.]

SIMONIDES  Knights,
To say you're welcome were superfluous.
To place upon the volume of your deeds,
As in a title page, your worth in arms
Were more than you expect or more than 's fit,
Since every worth in show commends itself.
Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast.
You are princes and my guests.

THAISA, [to Pericles]  But you my knight and guest,
To whom this wreath of victory I give
And crown you king of this day's happiness.
[She places a wreath on Pericles' head.]

'Tis more by fortune, lady, than my merit.

Call it by what you will, the day is yours,
And here, I hope, is none that envies it.
In framing an artist, Art hath thus decreed,
To make some good but others to exceed,
And you are her labored scholar.--Come, queen o'
the feast,
For, daughter, so you are; here, take your place.--
Marshal, the rest as they deserve their grace.

KNIGHTS
We are honored much by good Simonides.

Your presence glads our days. Honor we love,
For who hates honor hates the gods above.

MARSHAL, [to Pericles]  Sir, yonder is your place.

PERICLES  Some other is more fit.

Contend not, sir, for we are gentlemen
Have neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
Envies the great, nor shall the low despise.

You are right courteous knights.

SIMONIDES  Sit, sir, sit.	[They sit.]
[Aside.] By Jove I wonder, that is king of thoughts,
These cates resist me, he not thought upon.

THAISA, [aside]
By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
All viands that I eat do seem unsavory,
Wishing him my meat.--Sure, he's a gallant
gentleman.

He's but a country gentleman;
Has done no more than other knights have done;
Has broken a staff or so. So let it pass.

THAISA, [aside]
To me he seems like diamond to glass.

Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,
Which tells in that glory once he was--
Had princes sit like stars about his throne,
And he the sun for them to reverence.
None that beheld him but like lesser lights
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy;
Where now his son's like a glowworm in the night,
The which hath fire in darkness, none in light;
Whereby I see that Time's the king of men.
He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
And gives them what he will, not what they crave.

SIMONIDES  What, are you merry, knights?

KNIGHTS
Who can be other in this royal presence?

Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,
As do you love, fill to your mistress' lips.
We drink this health to you.	[He drinks.]

KNIGHTS  We thank your Grace.

Yet pause awhile. Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
As if the entertainment in our court
Had not a show might countervail his worth.--
Note it not you, Thaisa?

THAISA  What is 't to me, my father?

O, attend, my daughter. Princes in this
Should live like gods above, who freely give
To everyone that come to honor them.
And princes not doing so are like to gnats,
Which make a sound but, killed, are wondered at.
Therefore, to make his entrance more sweet,
Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.

Alas, my father, it befits not me
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold.
He may my proffer take for an offense,
Since men take women's gifts for impudence.

SIMONIDES  How?
Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.

THAISA, [aside]
Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.

And furthermore tell him we desire to know of him
Of whence he is, his name and parentage.

THAISA, [going to Pericles]
The King, my father, sir, has drunk to you.

PERICLES  I thank him.

Wishing it so much blood unto your life.

I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.
[He drinks to Simonides.]

And further, he desires to know of you
Of whence you are, your name and parentage.

A gentleman of Tyre, my name Pericles.
My education been in arts and arms,
Who, looking for adventures in the world,
Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,
And after shipwrack driven upon this shore.

THAISA, [returning to her place]
He thanks your Grace; names himself Pericles,
A gentleman of Tyre,
Who only by misfortune of the seas,
Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.

Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
And will awake him from his melancholy.--
Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles
And waste the time which looks for other revels.
Even in your armors, as you are addressed,
Will well become a soldiers' dance.
I will not have excuse with saying this:
"Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,"
Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
[They dance.]
So, this was well asked, 'twas so well performed.
Come, sir.	[He presents Pericles to Thaisa.]
Here's a lady that wants breathing too,
And I have heard you knights of Tyre
Are excellent in making ladies trip,
And that their measures are as excellent.

In those that practice them they are, my lord.

O, that's as much as you would be denied
Of your fair courtesy.	[They dance.]
Unclasp, unclasp!
Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well;
[To Pericles.] But you the best.--Pages and lights, to
conduct
These knights unto their several lodgings. [To
Pericles.] Yours, sir,
We have given order be next our own.

PERICLES  I am at your Grace's pleasure.

Princes, it is too late to talk of love,
And that's the mark I know you level at.
Therefore each one betake him to his rest,
Tomorrow all for speeding do their best.


3 Chorus

Now sleep yslacked hath the rout;
No din but snores about the house,
Made louder by the o'erfed breast
Of this most pompous marriage feast.
The cat with eyne of burning coal
Now couches from the mouse's hole,
And crickets sing at the oven's mouth
Are the blither for their drouth.
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,
Where, by the loss of maidenhead,
A babe is molded. Be attent,
And time that is so briefly spent
With your fine fancies quaintly eche.
What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.


Enter Pericles and Simonides at one door with
Attendants. A Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives
Pericles a letter. Pericles shows it Simonides. The Lords
kneel to him; then enter Thaisa with child, with
Lychorida, a nurse. The King shows her the letter. She
rejoices. She and Pericles take leave of her father, and
depart with Lychorida and their Attendants. Then
Simonides and the others exit.

By many a dern and painful perch
Of Pericles the careful search,
By the four opposing coigns
Which the world together joins,
Is made with all due diligence
That horse and sail and high expense
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
Fame answering the most strange enquire,
To th' court of King Simonides
Are letters brought, the tenor these:
Antiochus and his daughter dead,
The men of Tyrus on the head
Of Helicanus would set on
The crown of Tyre, but he will none.
The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress,
Says to 'em, if King Pericles
Come not home in twice six moons,
He, obedient to their dooms,
Will take the crown. The sum of this,
Brought hither to Pentapolis,
Y-ravished the regions round,
And everyone with claps can sound,
"Our heir apparent is a king!
Who dreamt, who thought of such a thing?"
Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre.
His queen, with child, makes her desire--
Which who shall cross?--along to go.
Omit we all their dole and woe.
Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
On Neptune's billow. Half the flood
Hath their keel cut. But Fortune, moved,
Varies again. The grizzled North
Disgorges such a tempest forth
That, as a duck for life that dives,
So up and down the poor ship drives.
The lady shrieks and, well-anear,
Does fall in travail with her fear.
And what ensues in this fell storm
Shall for itself itself perform.
I nill relate; action may
Conveniently the rest convey,
Which might not what by me is told.
In your imagination hold
This stage the ship upon whose deck
The sea-tossed Pericles appears to speak.

[Enter Pericles, at Tarsus, with Cleon and Dionyza, and
Lychorida with the child.]

Most honored Cleon, I must needs be gone.
My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
In a litigious peace. You and your lady
Take from my heart all thankfulness. The gods
Make up the rest upon you.

Your shakes of fortune, though they haunt you
mortally,
Yet glance full wond'ringly on us.

O, your sweet queen! That the strict Fates had pleased
You had brought her hither to have blessed mine
eyes with her!

We cannot but obey the powers above us.
Could I rage and roar as doth the sea
She lies in, yet the end must be as 'tis.
My gentle babe Marina,
Whom, for she was born at sea, I have named so,
Here I charge your charity withal,
Leaving her the infant of your care,
Beseeching you to give her princely training,
That she may be mannered as she is born.

CLEON  Fear not, my lord, but think
Your Grace, that fed my country with your corn,
For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
Should therein make me vile, the common body,
By you relieved, would force me to my duty.
But if to that my nature need a spur,
The gods revenge it upon me and mine,
To the end of generation!

PERICLES  I believe you.
Your honor and your goodness teach me to 't
Without your vows.--Till she be married, madam,
By bright Diana, whom we honor, all
Unscissored shall this hair of mine remain,
Though I show ill in 't. So I take my leave.
Good madam, make me blessed in your care
In bringing up my child.

DIONYZA  I have one myself,
Who shall not be more dear to my respect
Than yours, my lord.

PERICLES  Madam, my thanks and prayers.

We'll bring your Grace e'en to the edge o' th' shore,
Then give you up to the masked Neptune
And the gentlest winds of heaven.

I will embrace your offer.--Come, dearest madam.--
O, no tears, Lychorida, no tears!
Look to your little mistress, on whose grace
You may depend hereafter.--Come, my lord.



Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
   Into an honest house, our story says.
She sings like one immortal, and she dances
   As goddesslike to her admired lays.
Deep clerks she dumbs, and with her neele composes
   Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
That even her art sisters the natural roses.
   Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry,
That pupils lacks she none of noble race,
   Who pour their bounty on her, and her gain
She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place,
   And to her father turn our thoughts again,
Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost,
   Where, driven before the winds, he is arrived
Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
   Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
God Neptune's annual feast to keep, from whence
   Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
His banners sable, trimmed with rich expense,
   And to him in his barge with fervor hies.
In your supposing once more put your sight
   Of heavy Pericles. Think this his bark,
Where what is done in action--more, if might--
   Shall be discovered. Please you sit and hark.

[Enter the King with Green and Bagot, at one door,
and the Lord Aumerle at another.]

KING RICHARD  We did observe.--Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?

I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the next highway, and there I left him.

And say, what store of parting tears were shed?

Faith, none for me, except the northeast wind,
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
Awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.

What said our cousin when you parted with him?

AUMERLE  "Farewell."
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
That words seemed buried in my sorrow's grave.
Marry, would the word "farewell" have lengthened
hours
And added years to his short banishment,
He should have had a volume of farewells.
But since it would not, he had none of me.

He is our cousin, cousin, but 'tis doubt,
When time shall call him home from banishment,
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green,
Observed his courtship to the common people,
How he did seem to dive into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtesy,
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of his fortune,
As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench;
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee,
With "Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends,"
As were our England in reversion his
And he our subjects' next degree in hope.

Well, he is gone, and with him go these thoughts.
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
Ere further leisure yield them further means
For their advantage and your Highness' loss.

We will ourself in person to this war.
And, for our coffers, with too great a court
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
We are enforced to farm our royal realm,
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
For our affairs in hand. If that come short,
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters,
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
And send them after to supply our wants,
For we will make for Ireland presently.

[Enter Bushy.]

Bushy, what news?

Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
Suddenly taken, and hath sent posthaste
To entreat your Majesty to visit him.

KING RICHARD  Where lies he?

BUSHY  At Ely House.

Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
To help him to his grave immediately!
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him.
Pray God we may make haste and come too late.

ALL  Amen!

[Drums. Flourish and colors. Enter the King, Aumerle,
Carlisle, and Soldiers.]

Barkloughly Castle call they this at hand?

Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?

Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy
To stand upon my kingdom once again.	[He kneels.]
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs.
As a long-parted mother with her child
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
And do thee favors with my royal hands.
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense,
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
Which with usurping steps do trample thee.
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies,
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder,
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords.
This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.

Fear not, my lord. That power that made you king
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
The means that heavens yield must be embraced
And not neglected. Else heaven would,
And we will not--heaven's offer we refuse,
The proffered means of succor and redress.

He means, my lord, that we are too remiss,
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
Grows strong and great in substance and in power.

Discomfortable cousin, know'st thou not
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid
Behind the globe that lights the lower world,
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage boldly here?
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light through every guilty hole,
Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
The cloak of night being plucked from off their
backs,
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves.
So when this thief, this traitor Bolingbroke,
Who all this while hath reveled in the night
Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
Not able to endure the sight of day,
But self-affrighted, tremble at his sin.
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king.
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The deputy elected by the Lord.
For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
God for His Richard hath in heavenly pay
A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.


Welcome, my lord. How far off lies your power?

Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
Than this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.
O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men.
Today, today, unhappy day too late,
Overthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state;
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,
Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed, and fled.

Comfort, my liege. Why looks your Grace so pale?

But now the blood of twenty thousand men
   Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
And till so much blood thither come again
   Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
All souls that will be safe, fly from my side,
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.

Comfort, my liege. Remember who you are.

I had forgot myself. Am I not king?
Awake, thou coward majesty, thou sleepest!
Is not the King's name twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
You favorites of a king. Are we not high?
High be our thoughts. I know my Uncle York
Hath power enough to serve our turn.--But who
comes here?

[Enter Scroop.]

More health and happiness betide my liege
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him.

Mine ear is open and my heart prepared.
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, 'twas my care,
And what loss is it to be rid of care?
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
Greater he shall not be. If he serve God,
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so.
Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend.
They break their faith to God as well as us.
Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay.
The worst is death, and death will have his day.

Glad am I that your Highness is so armed
To bear the tidings of calamity.
Like an unseasonable stormy day
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
So high above his limits swells the rage
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
Whitebeards have armed their thin and hairless
scalps
Against thy Majesty; boys with women's voices
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;
Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
Of double-fatal yew against thy state.
Yea, distaff women manage rusty bills
Against thy seat. Both young and old rebel,
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.

Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?
What is become of Bushy? Where is Green,
That they have let the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it!
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.

Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.

O villains, vipers, damned without redemption!
Dogs easily won to fawn on any man!
Snakes in my heart blood warmed, that sting my
heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
Would they make peace? Terrible hell
Make war upon their spotted souls for this!

Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.
Again uncurse their souls. Their peace is made
With heads and not with hands. Those whom you
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.

Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?

Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.

Where is the Duke my father with his power?

No matter where. Of comfort no man speak.
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,
Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.
Let's choose executors and talk of wills.
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can we call our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings--
How some have been deposed, some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,
Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed,
All murdered. For within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court, and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be feared, and kill with looks,
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
As if this flesh which walls about our life
Were brass impregnable; and humored thus,
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, king!
Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence. Throw away respect,
Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,
For you have but mistook me all this while.
I live with bread like you, feel want,
Taste grief, need friends. Subjected thus,
How can you say to me I am a king?

My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
But presently prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
And so your follies fight against yourself.
Fear, and be slain--no worse can come to fight;
And fight and die is death destroying death,
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

My father hath a power. Inquire of him,
And learn to make a body of a limb.

Thou chid'st me well.--Proud Bolingbroke, I come
To change blows with thee for our day of doom.--
This ague fit of fear is overblown.
An easy task it is to win our own.--
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.

Men judge by the complexion of the sky
   The state and inclination of the day;
So may you by my dull and heavy eye.
   My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
I play the torturer by small and small
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken.
Your uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke,
And all your northern castles yielded up,
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party.

KING RICHARD  Thou hast said enough.
[To Aumerle.] Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst
lead me forth
Of that sweet way I was in to despair.
What say you now? What comfort have we now?
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
That bids me be of comfort anymore.
Go to Flint Castle. There I'll pine away;
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
That power I have, discharge, and let them go
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
For I have none. Let no man speak again
To alter this, for counsel is but vain.

My liege, one word.

KING RICHARD  He does me double wrong
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
Discharge my followers. Let them hence away,
From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.

[Flourish. Enter King Edward, sick, Queen Elizabeth,
Lord Marquess Dorset, Rivers, Hastings, Buckingham,
Woodeville, Grey, and Scales.]

Why, so. Now have I done a good day's work.
You peers, continue this united league.
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence,
And more in peace my soul shall part to heaven
Since I have made my friends at peace on Earth.
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand.
Dissemble not your hatred. Swear your love.

RIVERS, [taking Hastings' hand]
By heaven, my soul is purged from grudging hate,
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.

So thrive I as I truly swear the like.

Take heed you dally not before your king,
Lest He that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood and award
Either of you to be the other's end.

So prosper I as I swear perfect love.

And I as I love Hastings with my heart.

KING EDWARD, [to Queen Elizabeth]
Madam, yourself is not exempt from this,--
Nor you, son Dorset,--Buckingham, nor you.
You have been factious one against the other.--
Wife, love Lord Hastings. Let him kiss your hand,
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

There, Hastings, I will never more remember
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine.
[Hastings kisses her hand.]

Dorset, embrace him.--Hastings, love Lord
Marquess.

This interchange of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be inviolable.

HASTINGS  And so swear I.	[They embrace.]

Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
With thy embracements to my wife's allies
And make me happy in your unity.

Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love.
When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend,
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile
Be he unto me: this do I beg of God,
When I am cold in love to you or yours.
[Queen Elizabeth and Buckingham embrace.]

A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
To make the blessed period of this peace.

BUCKINGHAM  And in good time
Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the Duke.

[Enter Ratcliffe, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester.]

Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen,
And, princely peers, a happy time of day.

Happy indeed, as we have spent the day.
Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,
Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
Between these swelling, wrong-incensed peers.

A blessed labor, my most sovereign lord.
Among this princely heap, if any here
By false intelligence or wrong surmise
Hold me a foe,
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
By any in this presence, I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace.
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;--
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;--
Of you and you, Lord Rivers and of Dorset,
That all without desert have frowned on me;--
Of you, Lord Woodeville and Lord Scales;--of you,
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born tonight.
I thank my God for my humility.

A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.

Why, madam, have I offered love for this,
To be so flouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?
[They all start.]
You do him injury to scorn his corse.

Who knows not he is dead! Who knows he is?

All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!

Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?

Ay, my good lord, and no man in the presence
But his red color hath forsook his cheeks.

Is Clarence dead? The order was reversed.

But he, poor man, by your first order died,
And that a winged Mercury did bear.
Some tardy cripple bare the countermand,
That came too lag to see him buried.
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
Nearer in bloody thoughts, and not in blood,
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
And yet go current from suspicion.

[Enter Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby.]

STANLEY, [kneeling]
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done.

I prithee, peace. My soul is full of sorrow.

I will not rise unless your Highness hear me.

Then say at once what is it thou requests.

The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life,
Who slew today a riotous gentleman
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.

Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
My brother killed no man; his fault was thought,
And yet his punishment was bitter death.
Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,
Kneeled at my feet, and bade me be advised?
Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?
Who told me, in the field at Tewkesbury,
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
And said "Dear brother, live, and be a king"?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his garments and did give himself,
All thin and naked, to the numb-cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully plucked, and not a man of you
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting vassals
Have done a drunken slaughter and defaced
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon,
And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.
[Stanley rises.]
But for my brother, not a man would speak,
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
Have been beholding to him in his life,
Yet none of you would once beg for his life.
O God, I fear Thy justice will take hold
On me and you, and mine and yours for this!--
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.--
Ah, poor Clarence.
[Some exit with King and Queen.]

This is the fruits of rashness. Marked you not
How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the King.
God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go
To comfort Edward with our company?

BUCKINGHAM  We wait upon your Grace.


[Enter Queen Elizabeth, with the Duchess of York, and
the Lord Marquess of Dorset, at one door; Anne,
Duchess of Gloucester with Clarence's daughter, at
another door.]

Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heart's love, to greet the tender prince.--
Daughter, well met.

ANNE  God give your Graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day.

As much to you, good sister. Whither away?

No farther than the Tower, and, as I guess,
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
To gratulate the gentle princes there.

Kind sister, thanks. We'll enter all together.

[Enter Brakenbury, the Lieutenant.]

And in good time here the Lieutenant comes.--
Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
How doth the Prince and my young son of York?

Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
I may not suffer you to visit them.
The King hath strictly charged the contrary.

The King? Who's that?

BRAKENBURY  I mean, the Lord Protector.

The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
I am their mother. Who shall bar me from them?

I am their father's mother. I will see them.

Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
Then bring me to their sights. I'll bear thy blame
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.

No, madam, no. I may not leave it so.
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
[Brakenbury the Lieutenant exits.]

[Enter Stanley.]

Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence,
And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother
And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.
[To Anne.] Come, madam, you must straight to
Westminster,
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH  Ah, cut my lace asunder
That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,
Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!

Despiteful tidings! O, unpleasing news!

Be of good cheer, mother. How fares your Grace?

O Dorset, speak not to me. Get thee gone.
Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels.
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
If thou wilt outstrip death, go, cross the seas,
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughterhouse,
Lest thou increase the number of the dead
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
[To Dorset.] Take all the swift advantage of the
You shall have letters from me to my son
In your behalf, to meet you on the way.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
A cockatrice hast thou hatched to the world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

STANLEY, [to Anne]
Come, madam, come. I in all haste was sent.

And I with all unwillingness will go.
O, would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains!
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
And die ere men can say "God save the Queen."

Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory.
To feed my humor, wish thyself no harm.

No? Why? When he that is my husband now
Came to me as I followed Henry's corse,
When scarce the blood was well washed from his
hands
Which issued from my other angel husband
And that dear saint which then I weeping followed--
O, when, I say, I looked on Richard's face,
This was my wish: be thou, quoth I, accursed
For making me, so young, so old a widow;
And, when thou wedd'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
And be thy wife, if any be so mad,
More miserable by the life of thee
Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death.
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Within so small a time my woman's heart
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
And proved the subject of mine own soul's curse,
Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest,
For never yet one hour in his bed
Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
But with his timorous dreams was still awaked.
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick,
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

Poor heart, adieu. I pity thy complaining.

No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.

Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory.

Adieu, poor soul that tak'st thy leave of it.

DUCHESS, [to Dorset]
Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee.
[To Anne.] Go thou to Richard, and good angels
tend thee.
[To Queen Elizabeth.] Go thou to sanctuary, and
good thoughts possess thee.
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me.
Eighty-odd years of sorrow have I seen,
And each hour's joy wracked with a week of teen.

Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.--
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within your walls--
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
For tender princes, use my babies well.
So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.

[Sound a sennet. Enter Richard in pomp; Buckingham,
Catesby, Ratcliffe, Lovell, and others, including a Page.]

Stand all apart.--Cousin of Buckingham.
[The others move aside.]

BUCKINGHAM  My gracious sovereign.

[Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound trumpets.]
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy assistance is King Richard seated.
But shall we wear these glories for a day,
Or shall they last and we rejoice in them?

Still live they, and forever let them last.

Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
To try if thou be current gold indeed:
Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak.

BUCKINGHAM  Say on, my loving lord.

Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king.

Why so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.

Ha! Am I king? 'Tis so--but Edward lives.

True, noble prince.

RICHARD  O bitter consequence
That Edward still should live "true noble prince"!
Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead,
And I would have it suddenly performed.
What sayst thou now? Speak suddenly. Be brief.

BUCKINGHAM  Your Grace may do your pleasure.

Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?

Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord,
Before I positively speak in this.
I will resolve you herein presently.

CATESBY, [aside to the other Attendants]
The King is angry. See, he gnaws his lip.

I will converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys. None are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes.
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.--
Boy!

PAGE, [coming forward]  My lord?

Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?

I know a discontented gentleman
Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
Gold were as good as twenty orators,
And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.


PAGE  His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.

I partly know the man. Go, call him hither, boy.
[Aside.] The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels.
Hath he so long held out with me, untired,
And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.

[Enter Stanley.]

How now, Lord Stanley, what's the news?

STANLEY  Know, my loving lord,
The Marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled
To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.
[He walks aside.]

Come hither, Catesby. Rumor it abroad
That Anne my wife is very grievous sick.
I will take order for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter.
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
That Anne my queen is sick and like to die.
About it, for it stands me much upon
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
[Aside.] I must be married to my brother's daughter,
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Murder her brothers, and then marry her--
Uncertain way of gain. But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.


Is thy name Tyrrel?

James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.

Art thou indeed?

TYRREL  Prove me, my gracious lord.

Dar'st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

Please you. But I had rather kill two enemies.

Why then, thou hast it. Two deep enemies,
Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep's disturbers,
Are they that I would have thee deal upon.
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

Let me have open means to come to them,
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.

Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel.
[Tyrrel approaches Richard and kneels.]
Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear.
[Tyrrel rises, and Richard whispers
to him. Then Tyrrel steps back.]
There is no more but so. Say it is done,
And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.

TYRREL  I will dispatch it straight.	[He exits.]


My lord, I have considered in my mind
The late request that you did sound me in.

Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM  I hear the news, my lord.

Stanley, he is your wife's son. Well, look unto it.

My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,
For which your honor and your faith is pawned--
Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables
Which you have promised I shall possess.

Stanley, look to your wife. If she convey
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.

What says your Highness to my just request?

I do remember me, Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
A king perhaps--

BUCKINGHAM  My lord--

How chance the prophet could not at that time
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?

My lord, your promise for the earldom--

Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
The Mayor in courtesy showed me the castle
And called it Rougemont, at which name I started,
Because a bard of Ireland told me once
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM  My lord--

RICHARD  Ay, what's o'clock?

I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind
Of what you promised me.

RICHARD  Well, but what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM  Upon the stroke of ten.

RICHARD  Well, let it strike.

BUCKINGHAM  Why let it strike?

Because that, like a jack, thou keep'st the stroke
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein today.

Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.

Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
[He exits, and is followed by all but Buckingham.]

And is it thus? Repays he my deep service
With such contempt? Made I him king for this?
O, let me think on Hastings and be gone
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!

[Enter Stanley, Earl of Derby, and Sir Christopher.]

Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
That in the sty of the most deadly boar
My son George Stanley is franked up in hold;
If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
The fear of that holds off my present aid.
So get thee gone. Commend me to thy lord.
Withal, say that the Queen hath heartily consented
He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
But tell me, where is princely Richmond now?

CHRISTOPHER
At Pembroke, or at Ha'rfordwest in Wales.

STANLEY  What men of name resort to him?

CHRISTOPHER
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley,
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew,
And many other of great name and worth;
And towards London do they bend their power,
If by the way they be not fought withal.

STANLEY, [giving Sir Christopher a paper]
Well, hie thee to thy lord. I kiss his hand.
My letter will resolve him of my mind.

[Alarum. Excursions. Enter Norfolk, with Soldiers, and
Catesby.]

Rescue, my lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The King enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite to every danger.
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost.
[Norfolk exits with Soldiers.]

[Alarums. Enter Richard.]

A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!

Withdraw, my lord. I'll help you to a horse.

Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die.
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
Five have I slain today instead of him.
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!

[Enter Friar Lawrence alone with a basket.]

The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must upfill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The Earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave, that is her womb;
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some, and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
For naught so vile that on the Earth doth live
But to the Earth some special good doth give;
Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use,
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
And vice sometime by action dignified.


Within the infant rind of this weak flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each
part;
Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs--grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

Good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAWRENCE  Benedicite.
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distempered head
So soon to bid "Good morrow" to thy bed.
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And, where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth
reign.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uproused with some distemp'rature,
Or, if not so, then here I hit it right:
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.

That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.

God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
I have forgot that name and that name's woe.

That's my good son. But where hast thou been

I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies.
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.

Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
And all combined, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage. When and where and how
We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow
I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us today.

Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears.
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.
If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
And art thou changed? Pronounce this sentence
then:
Women may fall when there's no strength in men.

Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

And bad'st me bury love.

FRIAR LAWRENCE  Not in a grave
To lay one in, another out to have.

I pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
The other did not so.

FRIAR LAWRENCE  O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me.
In one respect I'll thy assistant be,
For this alliance may so happy prove
To turn your households' rancor to pure love.

O, let us hence. I stand on sudden haste.

Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.


Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

[Enter old Capulet.]

Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crowed.
The curfew bell hath rung. 'Tis three o'clock.--
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica.
Spare not for cost.

NURSE  Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed. Faith, you'll be sick tomorrow
For this night's watching.

No, not a whit. What, I have watched ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,
But I will watch you from such watching now.
[Lady Capulet and Nurse exit.]

A jealous hood, a jealous hood!

[Enter three or four Servingmen with spits and logs
and baskets.]

Now fellow,
What is there?

Things for the cook, sir, but I know not what.

Make haste, make haste.	[First Servingman exits.]
Sirrah, fetch drier logs.
Call Peter. He will show thee where they are.

I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
And never trouble Peter for the matter.

Mass, and well said. A merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be loggerhead.
Good faith, 'tis day.
The County will be here with music straight,
[Play music.]
For so he said he would. I hear him near.--
Nurse!--Wife! What ho!--What, nurse, I say!


Go waken Juliet. Go and trim her up.
I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
Make haste. The bridegroom he is come already.
Make haste, I say.

[Enter Paris and his Page.]

Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew trees lay thee all along,
Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground.
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
(Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me
As signal that thou hearest something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee. Go.

PAGE, [aside]
I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard. Yet I will adventure.
[He moves away from Paris.]

PARIS, [scattering flowers]
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
(O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones!)
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans.
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
[Page whistles.]
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.

[Enter Romeo and Balthasar.]

Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is partly to behold my lady's face,
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment. Therefore hence, begone.
But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I farther shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
[Giving money.]
Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.

BALTHASAR, [aside]
For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.

ROMEO, [beginning to force open the tomb]
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.

This is that banished haughty Montague
That murdered my love's cousin, with which grief
It is supposed the fair creature died,
And here is come to do some villainous shame
To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague.
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
Obey and go with me, for thou must die.

I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone.
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury. O, begone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
For I come hither armed against myself.
Stay not, begone, live, and hereafter say
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.

I do defy thy commination
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
[They draw and fight.]

O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.

O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb; lay me with Juliet.	[He dies.]

In faith, I will.--Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so?--O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.--
[He opens the tomb.]
A grave? O, no. A lantern, slaughtered youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.--
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.
[Laying Paris in the tomb.]
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry, which their keepers call
A light'ning before death! O, how may I
Call this a light'ning?--O my love, my wife,
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.--
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favor can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin.--Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that I still will stay with thee
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again. Here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.
Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
[Kissing Juliet.]
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
Here's to my love. [Drinking.] O true apothecary,
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

[Enter Friar Lawrence with lantern, crow, and spade.]

Saint Francis be my speed! How oft tonight
Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?

Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
It burneth in the Capels' monument.

It doth so, holy sir, and there's my master,
One that you love.

FRIAR LAWRENCE  Who is it?

BALTHASAR  Romeo.

How long hath he been there?

BALTHASAR  Full half an hour.

Go with me to the vault.

BALTHASAR  I dare not, sir.
My master knows not but I am gone hence,
And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents.

Stay, then. I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.

As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.

FRIAR LAWRENCE, [moving toward the tomb]
Romeo!--
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulcher?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolored by this place of peace?
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
And steeped in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs.

O comfortable friar, where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

I hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,
And Paris, too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.

Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
What's here? A cup closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.--
O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after! I will kiss thy lips.
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.	[She kisses him.]
Thy lips are warm!

[Enter Paris's Page and Watch.]

FIRST WATCH  Lead, boy. Which way?

Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O, happy dagger,
This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.
[She takes Romeo's dagger, stabs herself, and dies.]

This is the place, there where the torch doth burn.

The ground is bloody.--Search about the
churchyard.
Go, some of you; whoe'er you find, attach.
[Some watchmen exit.]
Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain this two days buried.--
Go, tell the Prince. Run to the Capulets.
Raise up the Montagues. Some others search.
[Others exit.]
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.

[Enter Watchmen with Romeo's man Balthasar.]

Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the
churchyard.

Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.

[Enter Friar Lawrence and another Watchman.]

Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
We took this mattock and this spade from him
As he was coming from this churchyard's side.

A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.

[Enter the Prince with Attendants.]

What misadventure is so early up
That calls our person from our morning rest?

[Enter Capulet and Lady Capulet.]

What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?

O, the people in the street cry "Romeo,"
Some "Juliet," and some "Paris," and all run
With open outcry toward our monument.

What fear is this which startles in our ears?

Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new killed.

Search, seek, and know how this foul murder

Here is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo's man,
With instruments upon them fit to open
These dead men's tombs.

O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.

O me, this sight of death is as a bell
That warns my old age to a sepulcher.

[Enter Montague.]

Come, Montague, for thou art early up
To see thy son and heir now early down.

Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath.
What further woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE  Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE, [seeing Romeo dead]
O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave?

Seal up the mouth of outrage for awhile,
Till we can clear these ambiguities
And know their spring, their head, their true
descent,
And then will I be general of your woes
And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.--
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me, of this direful murder.
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excused.

Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
I married them, and their stol'n marriage day
Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betrothed and would have married her perforce
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
A sleeping potion, which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night
To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stayed by accident, and yesternight
Returned my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awakening, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes, and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience.
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
And she, too desperate, would not go with me
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know, and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy. And if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed some hour before his time
Unto the rigor of severest law.

We still have known thee for a holy man.--
Where's Romeo's man? What can he say to this?

I brought my master news of Juliet's death,
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
If I departed not and left him there.

Give me the letter. I will look on it.--
[He takes Romeo's letter.]
Where is the County's page, that raised the
watch?--
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
And by and by my master drew on him,
And then I ran away to call the watch.

This letter doth make good the Friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies?--Capulet, Montague,
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,
And I, for winking at your discords too,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.

O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE  But I can give thee more,
For I will ray her statue in pure gold,
That whiles Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie,
Poor sacrifices of our enmity.

A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things.
Some shall be pardoned, and some punished.
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

  Think all but one, and me in that one will.

136

If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will,
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there.
Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfill.
Will will fulfill the treasure of thy love,
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Among a number one is reckoned none.
Then in the number let me pass untold,
Though in thy store's account I one must be.
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
That nothing me, a something, sweet, to thee.
  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
  And then thou lovest me, for my name is Will.

137

Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see?
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
If eyes, corrupt by overpartial looks,
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
  And to this false plague are they now transferred.

138

When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies,
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
Although she knows my days are past the best,
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue;
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,
  Therefore I lie with her and she with me,
  And in our faults by lies we flattered be.

139

O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Use power with power, and slay me not by art.
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside.
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my o'erpressed defense can bide?
Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries.
  Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
  Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.

140

Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so,
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
No news but health from their physicians know.
For if I should despair, I should grow mad,
And in my madness might speak ill of thee.
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
  That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.

141

In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone.
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be.
  Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
  That she that makes me sin awards me pain.

142

Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving.
Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee;
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
  By self-example mayst thou be denied.

143

Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away,
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face,
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
Whilst I, thy babe, chase thee afar behind.
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me
And play the mother's part: kiss me, be kind.
  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy will,
  If thou turn back and my loud crying still.

144

Which like two spirits do suggest me still.
The better angel is a man right fair,
The worser spirit a woman colored ill.
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
But being both from me, both to each friend,
  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,

145

Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
But when she saw my woeful state,
Straight in her heart did mercy come,
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom,
And taught it thus anew to greet:
"I hate" she altered with an end
That followed it as gentle day
Doth follow night, who, like a fiend,
From heaven to hell is flown away.
  "I hate" from hate away she threw,
  And saved my life, saying "not you."

146

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
And let that pine to aggravate thy store.
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
Within be fed, without be rich no more.
  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.

147

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please.
My reason, the physician to my love,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
Desire is death, which physic did except.
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
And, frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
At random from the truth vainly expressed.
  For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

148

O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
That censures falsely what they see aright?
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
What means the world to say it is not so?
If it be not, then love doth well denote
Love's eye is not so true as all men's "no."
How can it? O, how can love's eye be true,
That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
No marvel then though I mistake my view;
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
  O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.

149

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
Am of myself, all, tyrant, for thy sake?
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?
Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
Revenge upon myself with present moan?
What merit do I in myself respect
That is so proud thy service to despise,
When all my best doth worship thy defect,
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
  Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

150

O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantise of skill
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
O, though I love what others do abhor,
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.
  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
  More worthy I to be beloved of thee.

151

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.
For, thou betraying me, I do betray
My nobler part to my gross body's treason.
My soul doth tell my body that he may

[Enter Solinus the Duke of Ephesus, with Egeon the
Merchant of Syracuse, Jailer, and other Attendants.]

Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
And by the doom of death end woes and all.

Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.
I am not partial to infringe our laws.
The enmity and discord which of late
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
Have sealed his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.
For since the mortal and intestine jars
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
It hath in solemn synods been decreed,
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns.
Nay, more, if any born at Ephesus
Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs;
Again, if any Syracusian born
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose,
Unless a thousand marks be levied
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.

Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
Why thou departedst from thy native home
And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.

A heavier task could not have been imposed
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,
I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
In Syracusa was I born, and wed
Unto a woman happy but for me,
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
With her I lived in joy. Our wealth increased
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamium, till my factor's death
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself--almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear--
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
There had she not been long but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons,
And, which was strange, the one so like the other
As could not be distinguished but by names.
That very hour, and in the selfsame inn,
A mean woman was delivered
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
Made daily motions for our home return.
Unwilling, I agreed. Alas, too soon
We came aboard.
A league from Epidamium had we sailed
Before the always-wind-obeying deep
Gave any tragic instance of our harm;
But longer did we not retain much hope,
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death,
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
That mourned for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
And this it was, for other means was none:
The sailors sought for safety by our boat
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
Had fastened him unto a small spare mast,
Such as seafaring men provide for storms.
To him one of the other twins was bound,
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed,
Fastened ourselves at either end the mast
And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
Dispersed those vapors that offended us,
And by the benefit of his wished light
The seas waxed calm, and we discovered
Two ships from far, making amain to us,
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
But ere they came--O, let me say no more!
Gather the sequel by that went before.

Nay, forward, old man. Do not break off so,
For we may pity though not pardon thee.

O, had the gods done so, I had not now
Worthily termed them merciless to us.
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
We were encountered by a mighty rock,
Which being violently borne upon,
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
Fortune had left to both of us alike
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened
With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,
Was carried with more speed before the wind,
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
At length, another ship had seized on us
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests,
And would have reft the fishers of their prey
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss,
That by misfortunes was my life prolonged
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.

And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
Do me the favor to dilate at full
What have befall'n of them and thee till now.

My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
At eighteen years became inquisitive
After his brother, and importuned me
That his attendant--so his case was like,
Reft of his brother, but retained his name--
Might bear him company in the quest of him,
Whom whilst I labored of a love to see,
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
Or that or any place that harbors men.
But here must end the story of my life;
And happy were I in my timely death
Could all my travels warrant me they live.

Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have marked
To bear the extremity of dire mishap,
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
But though thou art adjudged to the death,
And passed sentence may not be recalled
But to our honor's great disparagement,
Yet will I favor thee in what I can.
Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
To seek thy life by beneficial help.
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
And live. If no, then thou art doomed to die.--
Jailer, take him to thy custody.

JAILER  I will, my lord.

Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

[Enter Antipholus of Syracuse, First Merchant, and
Dromio of Syracuse.]

FIRST MERCHANT
Therefore give out you are of Epidamium,
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here
And, not being able to buy out his life,
According to the statute of the town
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
There is your money that I had to keep.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, [handing money to Dromio]
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinnertime.
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.

Many a man would take you at your word
And go indeed, having so good a mean.
[Dromio of Syracuse exits.]

A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
Lightens my humor with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town
And then go to my inn and dine with me?

FIRST MERCHANT
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
Of whom I hope to make much benefit.
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
And afterward consort you till bedtime.
My present business calls me from you now.

Farewell till then. I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city.

FIRST MERCHANT
Sir, I commend you to your own content.	[He exits.]

He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.


Here comes the almanac of my true date.--
What now? How chance thou art returned so soon?

Returned so soon? Rather approached too late!
The capon burns; the pig falls from the spit;
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek.
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach, having broke your fast.
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default today.

Stop in your wind, sir. Tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?

O, sixpence that I had o' Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.

I am not in a sportive humor now.
Tell me, and dally not: where is the money?
We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?

I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will scour your fault upon my pate.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your
clock,
And strike you home without a messenger.

Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season.
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me!

Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.

My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.
My mistress and her sister stays for you.

Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
In what safe place you have bestowed my money,
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed.
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your Worship those again,
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.

Thy mistress' marks? What mistress, slave, hast

Your Worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix,
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, [beating Dromio]
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

What mean you, sir? For God's sake, hold your
Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
[Dromio of Ephesus exits.]

Upon my life, by some device or other
The villain is o'erraught of all my money.
They say this town is full of cozenage,
As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
And many suchlike liberties of sin.
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.
I greatly fear my money is not safe.

[Enter the masquers, Gratiano and Salarino.]

This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo
Desired us to make stand.

SALARINO  His hour is almost past.

And it is marvel he outdwells his hour,
For lovers ever run before the clock.

O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
To seal love's bonds new-made than they are wont
To keep obliged faith unforfeited.

That ever holds. Who riseth from a feast
With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire
That he did pace them first? All things that are,
Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed.
How like a younger or a prodigal
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
Hugged and embraced by the strumpet wind;
How like the prodigal doth she return
With overweathered ribs and ragged sails,
Lean, rent, and beggared by the strumpet wind!


Here comes Lorenzo. More of this hereafter.

Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode.
Not I but my affairs have made you wait.
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
I'll watch as long for you then. Approach.
Here dwells my father Jew.--Ho! Who's within?

[Enter Jessica above, dressed as a boy.]

Who are you? Tell me for more certainty,
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

LORENZO  Lorenzo, and thy love.

Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed,
For who love I so much? And now who knows
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.

Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
For I am much ashamed of my exchange.
But love is blind, and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit,
For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy.

Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light.
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,
And I should be obscured.

LORENZO  So are you, sweet,
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
But come at once,
For the close night doth play the runaway,
And we are stayed for at Bassanio's feast.

I will make fast the doors and gild myself
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
[Jessica exits, above.]

Now, by my hood, a gentle and no Jew!

Beshrew me but I love her heartily,
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
And true she is, as she hath proved herself.
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.

[Enter Jessica, below.]

What, art thou come? On, gentleman, away!
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
[All but Gratiano exit.]


ANTONIO  Who's there?

GRATIANO  Signior Antonio?

Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
'Tis nine o'clock! Our friends all stay for you.
No masque tonight; the wind is come about;
Bassanio presently will go aboard.
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

I am glad on 't. I desire no more delight
Than to be under sail and gone tonight.


[Enter Portia and Nerissa, still in disguise.]

Inquire the Jew's house out; give him this deed
And let him sign it. [She gives Nerissa a paper.] We'll
away tonight,
And be a day before our husbands home.
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.


Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.
My Lord Bassanio, upon more advice,
Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
Your company at dinner.	[He gives her a ring.]

PORTIA, [as Balthazar]  That cannot be.
His ring I do accept most thankfully,
And so I pray you tell him. Furthermore,
I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house.

That will I do.

NERISSA, [as Clerk]  Sir, I would speak with you.
[Aside to Portia.] I'll see if I can get my husband's
ring,
Which I did make him swear to keep forever.

PORTIA, [aside to Nerissa]
Thou mayst, I warrant! We shall have old swearing
That they did give the rings away to men;
But we'll outface them, and outswear them, too.--
Away, make haste! Thou know'st where I will tarry.

Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?

[Enter Lorenzo and Jessica.]

The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
And they did make no noise, in such a night
Troilus, methinks, mounted the Trojan walls
And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents
Where Cressid lay that night.

JESSICA  In such a night
Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
And ran dismayed away.

LORENZO  In such a night
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love
To come again to Carthage.

JESSICA  In such a night
Medea gathered the enchanted herbs
That did renew old Aeson.

LORENZO  In such a night
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
As far as Belmont.

JESSICA  In such a night
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,
And ne'er a true one.

LORENZO  In such a night
Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.

I would out-night you did nobody come,
But hark, I hear the footing of a man.

[Enter Stephano, a Messenger.]

Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

STEPHANO  A friend.

A friend? What friend? Your name, I pray you,

STEPHANO
Stephano is my name, and I bring word
My mistress will before the break of day
Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
For happy wedlock hours.

LORENZO  Who comes with her?

STEPHANO
None but a holy hermit and her maid.
I pray you, is my master yet returned?

He is not, nor we have not heard from him.--
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
And ceremoniously let us prepare
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.

[Enter Lancelet, the Clown.]

LANCELET  Sola, sola! Wo ha, ho! Sola, sola!

LORENZO  Who calls?

LANCELET  Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master
Lorenzo, sola, sola!

LORENZO  Leave holloaing, man! Here.

LANCELET  Sola! Where, where?

LORENZO  Here!

LANCELET  Tell him there's a post come from my master
with his horn full of good news. My master will
be here ere morning, sweet soul.	[Lancelet exits.]

LORENZO, [to Jessica]
Let's in, and there expect their coming.
And yet no matter; why should we go in?--
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
Within the house, your mistress is at hand,
And bring your music forth into the air.
[Stephano exits.]
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank.
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still choiring to the young-eyed cherubins.
Such harmony is in immortal souls,
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

[Enter Stephano and musicians.]

Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn.
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,
And draw her home with music.
[Music plays.]

I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

The reason is, your spirits are attentive.
For do but note a wild and wanton herd
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
Which is the hot condition of their blood,
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
Or any air of music touch their ears,
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze
By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and
floods,
Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
But music for the time doth change his nature.
The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
And his affections dark as Erebus.
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

[Enter Portia and Nerissa.]

That light we see is burning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

When the moon shone we did not see the candle.

So doth the greater glory dim the less.
A substitute shines brightly as a king
Until a king be by, and then his state
Empties itself as doth an inland brook
Into the main of waters. Music, hark!

It is your music, madam, of the house.

Nothing is good, I see, without respect.
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.

The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
When neither is attended, and I think
The nightingale, if she should sing by day
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
No better a musician than the wren.
How many things by season seasoned are
To their right praise and true perfection!
Peace--how the moon sleeps with Endymion
And would not be awaked!
[Music ceases.]

LORENZO  That is the voice,
Or I am much deceived, of Portia.

He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
By the bad voice.

LORENZO  Dear lady, welcome home.

We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,
Which speed we hope the better for our words.
Are they returned?

LORENZO  Madam, they are not yet,
But there is come a messenger before
To signify their coming.

PORTIA  Go in, Nerissa.
Give order to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence--
Nor you, Lorenzo--Jessica, nor you.

Your husband is at hand. I hear his trumpet.
We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.

This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
It looks a little paler. 'Tis a day
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.

[Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano, and their followers.]

We should hold day with the Antipodes
If you would walk in absence of the sun.

Let me give light, but let me not be light,
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
And never be Bassanio so for me.
But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.
[Gratiano and Nerissa talk aside.]

I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
This is the man, this is Antonio,
To whom I am so infinitely bound.

You should in all sense be much bound to him,
For as I hear he was much bound for you.

No more than I am well acquitted of.

Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
It must appear in other ways than words;
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

GRATIANO, [to Nerissa]
By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong!
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk.
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.

A quarrel ho, already! What's the matter?

About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
That she did give me, whose posy was
For all the world like cutler's poetry
Upon a knife, "Love me, and leave me not."

What talk you of the posy or the value?
You swore to me when I did give it you
That you would wear it till your hour of death,
And that it should lie with you in your grave.
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
You should have been respective and have kept it.
Gave it a judge's clerk! No, God's my judge,
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on 's face that had it.

He will, an if he live to be a man.

Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk,
A prating boy that begged it as a fee.
I could not for my heart deny it him.

You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift,
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it, and here he stands.
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.
An 'twere to me I should be mad at it.

BASSANIO, [aside]
Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
And swear I lost the ring defending it.

My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that begged it, and indeed
Deserved it, too. And then the boy, his clerk,
That took some pains in writing, he begged mine,
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings.

PORTIA  What ring gave you, my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

If I could add a lie unto a fault,
I would deny it, but you see my finger
Hath not the ring upon it. It is gone.

Even so void is your false heart of truth.
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
Until I see the ring!

NERISSA, [to Gratiano]  Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine!

BASSANIO  Sweet Portia,
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
If you did know for whom I gave the ring,
And would conceive for what I gave the ring,
And how unwillingly I left the ring,
When naught would be accepted but the ring,
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

If you had known the virtue of the ring,
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
Or your own honor to contain the ring,
You would not then have parted with the ring.
What man is there so much unreasonable,
If you had pleased to have defended it
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I'll die for 't but some woman had the ring!

No, by my honor, madam, by my soul,
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
And begged the ring, the which I did deny him
And suffered him to go displeased away,
Even he that had held up the very life
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
I was enforced to send it after him.
I was beset with shame and courtesy.
My honor would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,
For by these blessed candles of the night,
Had you been there, I think you would have begged
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

Let not that doctor e'er come near my house!
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
I will become as liberal as you:
I'll not deny him anything I have,
No, not my body, nor my husband's bed.
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus.
If you do not, if I be left alone,
Now by mine honor, which is yet mine own,
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

And I his clerk. Therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection.

Well, do you so. Let not me take him, then,
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.

I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.

Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome
notwithstanding.

Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,
And in the hearing of these many friends
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
Wherein I see myself--

PORTIA  Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,
In each eye one. Swear by your double self,
And there's an oath of credit.

BASSANIO  Nay, but hear me.
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee.

I once did lend my body for his wealth,
Which but for him that had your husband's ring
Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly.

Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,
[Giving Antonio a ring.]
And bid him keep it better than the other.

Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.

By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!

I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,
For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.
[She shows a ring.]

Why, this is like the mending of highways
In summer, where the ways are fair enough!
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?

Speak not so grossly.--You are all amazed.
[She hands a paper to Bassanio.]
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure.
It comes from Padua from Bellario.
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,
And even but now returned. I have not yet
Entered my house.--Antonio, you are welcome,
And I have better news in store for you
Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon.
There you shall find three of your argosies
Are richly come to harbor suddenly.
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter.

ANTONIO  I am dumb.

Were you the doctor and I knew you not?

Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
Unless he live until he be a man.

BASSANIO, [to Portia]
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road.

PORTIA  How now, Lorenzo?
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.

Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
There do I give to you and Jessica,
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
After his death, of all he dies possessed of.

Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
Of starved people.

PORTIA  It is almost morning,
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
Of these events at full. Let us go in,
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
And we will answer all things faithfully.

Let it be so. The first inter'gatory
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is
Whether till the next night she had rather stay
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.
But were the day come, I should wish it dark
Till I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
Well, while I live, I'll fear no other thing
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.


[Enter Fenton and Anne Page.]

I see I cannot get thy father's love;
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.

Alas, how then?

FENTON  Why, thou must be thyself.
He doth object I am too great of birth,
And that, my state being galled with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth.
Besides these, other bars he lays before me--
My riots past, my wild societies--
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.

ANNE  Maybe he tells you true.

No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
Was the first motive that I wooed thee, Anne,
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags.
And 'tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at.

ANNE  Gentle Master Fenton,
Yet seek my father's love, still seek it, sir.
If opportunity and humblest suit
Cannot attain it, why then--hark you hither.

[Enter Shallow, Slender, and Mistress Quickly.]

SHALLOW  Break their talk, Mistress Quickly. My kinsman
shall speak for himself.

SLENDER  I'll make a shaft or a bolt on 't. 'Slid, 'tis but
venturing.

SHALLOW  Be not dismayed.

SLENDER  No, she shall not dismay me. I care not for
that, but that I am afeard.

MISTRESS QUICKLY, [to Anne]  Hark ye, Master Slender
would speak a word with you.

I come to him. [(Aside.)] This is my father's choice.
O, what a world of vile ill-favored faults
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!

MISTRESS QUICKLY  And how does good Master Fenton?
Pray you, a word with you.	[They talk aside.]

SHALLOW, [to Slender]  She's coming. To her, coz! O
boy, thou hadst a father!

SLENDER  I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can
tell you good jests of him.--Pray you, uncle, tell
Mistress Anne the jest how my father stole two
geese out of a pen, good uncle.

SHALLOW  Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.

SLENDER  Ay, that I do, as well as I love any woman in
Gloucestershire.

SHALLOW  He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.

SLENDER  Ay, that I will, come cut and longtail, under
the degree of a squire.

SHALLOW  He will make you a hundred and fifty
pounds jointure.

ANNE  Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.

SHALLOW  Marry, I thank you for it. I thank you for that
good comfort.--She calls you, coz. I'll leave you.

ANNE  Now, Master Slender.

SLENDER  Now, good Mistress Anne.

ANNE  What is your will?

SLENDER  My will? 'Od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest
indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven. I
am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.

ANNE  I mean, Master Slender, what would you with

SLENDER  Truly, for mine own part, I would little or
nothing with you. Your father and my uncle hath
made motions. If it be my luck, so; if not, happy
man be his dole. They can tell you how things go
better than I can. You may ask your father.

[Enter Page and Mistress Page.]


Now, Master Slender.--Love him, daughter Anne.--
Why, how now? What does Master Fenton here?
You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house.
I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.

Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.

PAGE  She is no match for you.

FENTON  Sir, will you hear me?

PAGE  No, good Master Fenton.--
Come Master Shallow.--Come, son Slender, in.--
Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
[Page, Shallow, and Slender exit.]

MISTRESS QUICKLY, [to Fenton]  Speak to Mistress Page.

Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
In such a righteous fashion as I do,
Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,
I must advance the colors of my love
And not retire. Let me have your good will.

Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.

I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.

MISTRESS QUICKLY  That's my master, Master Doctor.

Alas, I had rather be set quick i' th' earth
And bowled to death with turnips!

Come, trouble not yourself.--Good Master Fenton,
I will not be your friend nor enemy.
My daughter will I question how she loves you,
And as I find her, so am I affected.
Till then, farewell, sir. She must needs go in;
Her father will be angry.

Farewell, gentle mistress.--Farewell, Nan.
[Mistress Page and Anne Page exit.]

MISTRESS QUICKLY  This is my doing now. "Nay," said I,
"will you cast away your child on a fool and a
physician? Look on Master Fenton." This is my

I thank thee; and I pray thee, once tonight
Give my sweet Nan this ring. There's for thy pains.
[He gives her money and a ring.]

MISTRESS QUICKLY  Now heaven send thee good fortune.
A kind heart he hath. A woman would run through
fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I
would my master had Mistress Anne, or I would
Master Slender had her, or, in sooth, I would Master
Fenton had her. I will do what I can for them all
three; for so I have promised and I'll be as good as
my word--but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,
I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from
my two mistresses. What a beast am I to slack it!

[Enter Sir John Falstaff and Mistress Quickly.]

FALSTAFF  Prithee, no more prattling. Go. I'll hold. This
is the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd numbers.
Away, go. They say there is divinity in odd
numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death.
Away.

MISTRESS QUICKLY  I'll provide you a chain, and I'll do
what I can to get you a pair of horns.

FALSTAFF  Away, I say! Time wears. Hold up your head,
and mince.	[Mistress Quickly exits.]


How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the
matter will be known tonight or never. Be you in
the park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you
shall see wonders.

FORD, [as Brook]  Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as
you told me you had appointed?

FALSTAFF  I went to her, Master Brook, as you see,
like a poor old man, but I came from her, Master
Brook, like a poor old woman. That same knave
Ford, her husband, hath the finest mad devil of
jealousy in him, Master Brook, that ever governed
frenzy. I will tell you, he beat me grievously,
in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man,
Master Brook, I fear not Goliath with a weaver's
beam, because I know also life is a shuttle. I am in
haste. Go along with me; I'll tell you all, Master
Brook. Since I plucked geese, played truant, and
whipped top, I knew not what 'twas to be beaten
till lately. Follow me. I'll tell you strange things of
this knave Ford, on whom tonight I will be revenged,
and I will deliver his wife into your hand.
Follow. Strange things in hand, Master Brook!
Follow.

[Enter Sir Hugh Evans and boys disguised,
like him, as Fairies.]

SIR HUGH  Trib, trib, fairies! Come, and remember
your parts. Be pold, I pray you. Follow me into the
pit, and when I give the watch-'ords, do as I pid
you. Come, come; trib, trib.	[They exit.]

[Enter Sir John Falstaff wearing a buck's head.]

FALSTAFF  The Windsor bell hath struck twelve. The
minute draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist
me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy
Europa; love set on thy horns. O powerful love,
that in some respects makes a beast a man, in
some other a man a beast! You were also, Jupiter,
a swan for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love,
how near the god drew to the complexion of a
goose! A fault done first in the form of a beast; O
Jove, a beastly fault! And then another fault in the
semblance of a fowl; think on 't, Jove, a foul fault.
When gods have hot backs, what shall poor men
do? For me, I am here a Windsor stag, and the fattest,
I think, i' th' forest. Send me a cool rut-time,
Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow?

[Enter Mistress Page and Mistress Ford.]

Who comes here? My doe?

MISTRESS FORD  Sir John? Art thou there, my deer, my
male deer?

FALSTAFF  My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
potatoes, let it thunder to the tune of "Greensleeves,"
hail kissing-comfits, and snow eryngoes; let there
come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me
here.	[He embraces her.]

MISTRESS FORD  Mistress Page is come with me,
sweetheart.

FALSTAFF  Divide me like a bribed buck, each a haunch.
I will keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for
the fellow of this walk, and my horns I bequeath
your husbands. Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like
Herne the Hunter? Why, now is Cupid a child of
conscience; he makes restitution. As I am a true
spirit, welcome.	[A noise of horns within.]

MISTRESS PAGE  Alas, what noise?

MISTRESS FORD  Heaven forgive our sins!

FALSTAFF  What should this be?

MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE  Away, away.
[The two women run off.]

FALSTAFF  I think the devil will not have me damned,
lest the oil that's in me should set hell on fire. He
would never else cross me thus.

[Enter Mistress Quickly, Pistol, Sir Hugh Evans,
Anne Page and boys, all disguised as Fairies and
carrying tapers.]

MISTRESS QUICKLY, [as Fairy Queen]
Fairies black, gray, green, and white,
You moonshine revelers and shades of night,
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
Attend your office and your quality.
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.

PISTOL, [as Hobgoblin]
Elves, list your names. Silence, you airy toys!--
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap,
Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths
unswept.
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry.
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.

FALSTAFF, [aside]
They are fairies. He that speaks to them shall die.
I'll wink and couch. No man their works must eye.
[He crouches down and covers his eyes.]

SIR HUGH, [as a fairy]
Where's Bead? Go you, and where you find a maid
That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said,
Raise up the organs of her fantasy;
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy.
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and
shins.

MISTRESS QUICKLY, [as Fairy Queen]  About, about!
Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out.
Strew good luck, aufs, on every sacred room,
That it may stand till the perpetual doom
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower.
Each fair installment, coat, and sev'ral crest
With loyal blazon evermore be blest!
And nightly, meadow fairies, look you sing,
Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring.
Th' expressure that it bears, green let it be,
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
And Honi soit qui mal y pense write
In em'rald tufts, flowers purple, blue, and white,
Like sapphire, pearl, and rich embroidery,
Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee.
Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
Away, disperse! But till 'tis one o'clock,
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the Hunter let us not forget.

SIR HUGH, [as a fairy]
Pray you, lock hand in hand. Yourselves in order set;
And twenty glowworms shall our lanterns be,
To guide our measure round about the tree.
But stay! I smell a man of Middle Earth.

FALSTAFF, [aside]  Heavens defend me from that Welsh
fairy, lest he transform me to a piece of cheese.

PISTOL, [as Hobgoblin, to Falstaff]
Vile worm, thou wast o'erlooked even in thy birth.

MISTRESS QUICKLY, [as Fairy Queen, to Sir Hugh]
With trial-fire touch me his finger-end.
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain. But if he start,
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.

PISTOL, [as Hobgoblin]
A trial, come!

SIR HUGH, [as a fairy]  Come, will this wood take fire?
[Sir Hugh puts a taper to Falstaff's finger, and he starts.]

FALSTAFF  O, O, O!

MISTRESS QUICKLY, [as Fairy Queen]
Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
About him, fairies. Sing a scornful rhyme,
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.

[Here they pinch him and sing about him, and Doctor
Caius comes one way and steals away a boy in white.
And Slender comes another way; he takes a boy in
green. And Fenton steals Mistress Anne Page.]

FAIRIES [sing]
	Fie on sinful fantasy!
	Fie on lust and luxury!
	Lust is but a bloody fire
	Kindled with unchaste desire,
	Fed in heart whose flames aspire
	As thoughts do blow them higher and higher.
	Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
	Pinch him for his villainy.
Pinch him and burn him and turn him about,
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.

[A noise of hunting is made within, and all the fairies
run away from Falstaff, who pulls off his buck's head
and rises up. Enter Page, Mistress Page,
Mistress Ford and Ford.]

PAGE, [to Falstaff]
Nay, do not fly. I think we have watched you now.
Will none but Herne the Hunter serve your turn?

I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher.--
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
[She points to the horns.]
See you these, husband? Do not these fair yokes
Become the forest better than the town?

FORD, [to Falstaff]  Now, sir, who's a cuckold now?
Master Brook, Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly
knave. Here are his horns, Master Brook. And,
Master Brook, he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford's
but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and twenty
pounds of money, which must be paid to Master
Brook. His horses are arrested for it, Master

MISTRESS FORD  Sir John, we have had ill luck. We
could never meet. I will never take you for my love
again, but I will always count you my deer.

FALSTAFF  I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.

FORD  Ay, and an ox too. Both the proofs are extant.

FALSTAFF  And these are not fairies. I was three or four
times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet
the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of
my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into
a received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent when 'tis upon
ill employment.

SIR HUGH  Sir John Falstaff, serve Got and leave your
desires, and fairies will not pinse you.

FORD  Well said, Fairy Hugh.

SIR HUGH  And leave you your jealousies too, I pray

FORD  I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
able to woo her in good English.

FALSTAFF  Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it,
that it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching
as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too?
Shall I have a coxcomb of frieze? 'Tis time I were
choked with a piece of toasted cheese.

SIR HUGH  Seese is not good to give putter. Your belly is
all putter.

FALSTAFF  "Seese" and "putter"? Have I lived to stand at
the taunt of one that makes fritters of English?
This is enough to be the decay of lust and late
walking through the realm.

MISTRESS PAGE  Why, Sir John, do you think though we
would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the
head and shoulders, and have given ourselves
without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could
have made you our delight?

FORD  What, a hodge-pudding? A bag of flax?

MISTRESS PAGE  A puffed man?

PAGE  Old, cold, withered, and of intolerable entrails?

FORD  And one that is as slanderous as Satan?

PAGE  And as poor as Job?

FORD  And as wicked as his wife?

SIR HUGH  And given to fornications, and to taverns,
and sack, and wine, and metheglins, and to drinkings
and swearings and starings, pribbles and
prabbles?

FALSTAFF  Well, I am your theme. You have the start of
me. I am dejected. I am not able to answer the
Welsh flannel. Ignorance itself is a plummet o'er
me. Use me as you will.

FORD  Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor to one
Master Brook, that you have cozened of money,
to whom you should have been a pander. Over and
above that you have suffered, I think to repay that
money will be a biting affliction.

PAGE  Yet be cheerful, knight. Thou shalt eat a posset
tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to
laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her
Master Slender hath married her daughter.

MISTRESS PAGE, [aside]  Doctors doubt that. If Anne
Page be my daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius'

[Enter Slender.]

SLENDER  Whoa, ho, ho, Father Page!

PAGE  Son, how now! How now, son! Have you
dispatched?

SLENDER  "Dispatched"? I'll make the best in Gloucestershire
know on 't. Would I were hanged, la, else!

PAGE  Of what, son?

SLENDER  I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress
Anne Page, and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had
not been i' th' church, I would have swinged him,
or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it
had been Anne Page, would I might never stir! And
'tis a post-master's boy.

PAGE  Upon my life, then, you took the wrong--

SLENDER  What need you tell me that? I think so, when
I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him,
for all he was in woman's apparel, I would not
have had him.

PAGE  Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you
how you should know my daughter by her
garments?

SLENDER  I went to her in white, and cried "mum,"
and she cried "budget," as Anne and I had appointed,
and yet it was not Anne, but a post-master's
boy.

MISTRESS PAGE  Good George, be not angry. I knew of
your purpose, turned my daughter into green,
and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery,
and there married.


DOCTOR CAIUS  Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened!
I ha' married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by
gar, a boy. It is not Anne Page. By gar, I am
cozened.

MISTRESS PAGE  Why? Did you take her in green?

DOCTOR CAIUS  Ay, be gar, and 'tis a boy. Be gar, I'll raise
all Windsor.

FORD  This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?

[Enter Fenton and Anne Page.]

PAGE  My heart misgives me. Here comes Master Fenton.--
How now, Master Fenton!

ANNE  Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.

PAGE  Now, mistress, how chance you went not with
Master Slender?

Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?

You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully,
Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
Th' offense is holy that she hath committed,
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.

FORD, [to Page and Mistress Page]
Stand not amazed. Here is no remedy.
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state.
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.

FALSTAFF  I am glad, though you have ta'en a special
stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath
glanced.

Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy.
What cannot be eschewed must be embraced.

When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.

Well, I will muse no further.--Master Fenton,
Heaven give you many, many merry days.--
Good husband, let us every one go home
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire--
Sir John and all.

FORD  Let it be so, Sir John.
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word,
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.

Let the bird of loudest lay
On the sole Arabian tree
Herald sad and trumpet be,
To whose sound chaste wings obey.

But thou shrieking harbinger,
Foul precurrer of the fiend,
Augur of the fever's end,
To this troop come thou not near.


[Enter Petruchio and his man Grumio.]

Verona, for a while I take my leave
To see my friends in Padua, but of all
My best beloved and approved friend,
Hortensio. And I trow this is his house.
Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.

GRUMIO  Knock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there
any man has rebused your Worship?

PETRUCHIO  Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.

GRUMIO  Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir,
that I should knock you here, sir?

Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.

My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
you first,
And then I know after who comes by the worst.

PETRUCHIO  Will it not be?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it.
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
[He wrings him by the ears. Grumio falls.]

GRUMIO  Help, mistress, help! My master is mad.

PETRUCHIO  Now knock when I bid you, sirrah

[Enter Hortensio.]

HORTENSIO  How now, what's the matter? My old
friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio? How
do you all at Verona?

Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
Con tutto il cuore ben trovato, may I say.

HORTENSIO  Alia nostra casa ben venuto, molto
honorato signor mio Petruchio.--Rise, Grumio,
rise. We will compound this quarrel.	[Grumio rises.]

GRUMIO  Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in
Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave
his service--look you, sir: he bid me knock him
and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit for a
servant to use his master so, being perhaps, for
aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out?
Whom, would to God, I had well knocked at first,
Then had not Grumio come by the worst.

A senseless villain, good Hortensio.
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
And could not get him for my heart to do it.

GRUMIO  Knock at the gate? O, heavens, spake you not
these words plain: "Sirrah, knock me here, rap me
here, knock me well, and knock me soundly"? And
come you now with "knocking at the gate"?

Sirrah, begone, or talk not, I advise you.

Petruchio, patience. I am Grumio's pledge.
Why, this' a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

Such wind as scatters young men through the world
To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Antonio, my father, is deceased,
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Happily to wive and thrive, as best I may.
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
And so am come abroad to see the world.

Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favored wife?
Thou 'dst thank me but a little for my counsel--
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
And very rich. But thou 'rt too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to her.

Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice. And therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife
(As wealth is burden of my wooing dance),
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
She moves me not, or not removes at least
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

GRUMIO, [to Hortensio]  Nay, look you, sir, he tells you
flatly what his mind is. Why, give him gold enough
and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an
old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though she
have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses. Why,
nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.

Petruchio, since we are stepped thus far in,
I will continue that I broached in jest.
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
With wealth enough, and young and beauteous,
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
Is that she is intolerable curst,
And shrewd, and froward, so beyond all measure
That, were my state far worser than it is,
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

Hortensio, peace. Thou know'st not gold's effect.
Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
For I will board her, though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.

Her father is Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous gentleman.
Her name is Katherina Minola,
Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue.

I know her father, though I know not her,
And he knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter--
Unless you will accompany me thither.

GRUMIO, [to Hortensio]  I pray you, sir, let him go while
the humor lasts. O' my word, an she knew him as
well as I do, she would think scolding would do little
good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a
score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; an he begin
once, he'll rail in his rope tricks. I'll tell you what,
sir, an she stand him but a little, he will throw a
figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that
she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
You know him not, sir.

Tarry, Petruchio. I must go with thee,
For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,
And her withholds from me and other more,
Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
Supposing it a thing impossible,
For those defects I have before rehearsed,
That ever Katherina will be wooed.
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.

GRUMIO  "Katherine the curst,"
A title for a maid, of all titles the worst.

Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace
And offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca,
That so I may, by this device at least,
Have leave and leisure to make love to her
And unsuspected court her by herself.

GRUMIO  Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old
folks, how the young folks lay their heads together!

[Enter Gremio and Lucentio, disguised as Cambio, a
schoolmaster.]

Master, master, look about you. Who goes there, ha?

Peace, Grumio, it is the rival of my love.
Petruchio, stand by awhile.
[Petruchio, Hortensio, and Grumio stand aside.]

GRUMIO, [aside]
A proper stripling, and an amorous.

GREMIO, [to Lucentio]
O, very well, I have perused the note.
Hark you, sir, I'll have them very fairly bound,
All books of love. See that at any hand,
And see you read no other lectures to her.
You understand me. Over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too.
And let me have them very well perfumed,
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?

Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
As for my patron, stand you so assured,
As firmly as yourself were still in place,
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Than you--unless you were a scholar, sir.

O this learning, what a thing it is!

GRUMIO, [aside]
O this woodcock, what an ass it is!

PETRUCHIO, [aside]  Peace, sirrah.

Grumio, mum.	[Coming forward.]
God save you, Signior Gremio.

And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
I promised to enquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca,
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man, for learning and behavior
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books--good ones, I warrant you.

'Tis well. And I have met a gentleman
Hath promised me to help me to another,
A fine musician to instruct our mistress.
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.

Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove.

GRUMIO, [aside]  And that his bags shall prove.

Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
[Presenting Petruchio.]
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Will undertake to woo curst Katherine,
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.

GREMIO  So said, so done, is well.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

I know she is an irksome, brawling scold.
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

No? Sayst me so, friend? What countryman?

Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.
My father dead, my fortune lives for me,
And I do hope good days and long to see.

Oh, sir, such a life with such a wife were strange.
But if you have a stomach, to 't, i' God's name!
You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wildcat?

PETRUCHIO  Will I live?

Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.

Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds,
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets clang?
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
Tush, tush, fear boys with bugs!

GRUMIO  For he fears none.

GREMIO  Hortensio, hark.
This gentleman is happily arrived,
My mind presumes, for his own good and yours.

I promised we would be contributors
And bear his charge of wooing whatsoe'er.

And so we will, provided that he win her.

I would I were as sure of a good dinner.

[Enter Tranio, disguised as Lucentio, and Biondello.]

Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?

BIONDELLO  He that has the two fair daughters--is 't
he you mean?

TRANIO, [as Lucentio]  Even he, Biondello.

Hark you, sir, you mean not her to--

Perhaps him and her, sir. What have you to do?

Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.

I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.

Well begun, Tranio.

HORTENSIO  Sir, a word ere you go.
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?

An if I be, sir, is it any offense?

No, if without more words you will get you hence.

Why sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me, as for you?

GREMIO  But so is not she.

For what reason, I beseech you?

For this reason, if you'll know:
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.

That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.

Softly, my masters. If you be gentlemen,
Do me this right: hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman
To whom my father is not all unknown,
And were his daughter fairer than she is,
She may more suitors have, and me for one.
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers.
Then well one more may fair Bianca have.
And so she shall. Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!

Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.

Hortensio, to what end are all these words?

HORTENSIO, [to Tranio]
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?

No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty.

Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.

Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules,
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.

PETRUCHIO, [to Tranio]
Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:
The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
Her father keeps from all access of suitors
And will not promise her to any man
Until the elder sister first be wed.
The younger then is free, and not before.

If it be so, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest,
And if you break the ice and do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive.
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
To whom we all rest generally beholding.

Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
Please you we may contrive this afternoon
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
And do as adversaries do in law,
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

GRUMIO and BIONDELLO
O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

The motion's good indeed, and be it so.--
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.



[Enter Tranio as Lucentio, and the Merchant, booted,
and dressed like Vincentio.]

Sir, this is the house. Please it you that I call?

Ay, what else? And but I be deceived,
Signior Baptista may remember me,
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.

'Tis well. And hold your own in any case
With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.

I warrant you.


But, sir, here comes your boy.
'Twere good he were schooled.

Fear you not him.--Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.

BIONDELLO  Tut, fear not me.

But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

I told him that your father was at Venice,
And that you looked for him this day in Padua.

Thou 'rt a tall fellow. Hold thee that to drink.
[He gives him money.]

[Enter Baptista and Lucentio as Cambio.]

Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.
[Merchant stands bareheaded.]

Signior Baptista, you are happily met.--
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.
I pray you stand good father to me now.
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

MERCHANT, [as Vincentio]  Soft, son.--
Sir, by your leave, having come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself.
And, for the good report I hear of you,
And for the love he beareth to your daughter
And she to him, to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father's care,
To have him matched. And if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestowed,
For curious I cannot be with you,
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.

Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble deeply their affections.
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
That like a father you will deal with him
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done.
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be affied and such assurance ta'en
As shall with either part's agreement stand?

Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.
Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still,
And happily we might be interrupted.

Then at my lodging, an it like you.
There doth my father lie, and there this night
We'll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here.
[He indicates Lucentio, and winks at him.]
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this: that at so slender warning
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

It likes me well.--Cambio, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight.
And, if you will, tell what hath happened:
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
[Lucentio exits.]

I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.

Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.--
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer.
Come, sir, we will better it in Pisa.

BAPTISTA  I follow you.
[All but Biondello exit.]

[Enter Lucentio.]

BIONDELLO  Cambio.

LUCENTIO  What sayst thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO  You saw my master wink and laugh upon

LUCENTIO  Biondello, what of that?

BIONDELLO  Faith, nothing; but 'has left me here behind
to expound the meaning or moral of his signs
and tokens.

LUCENTIO  I pray thee, moralize them.

BIONDELLO  Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with
the deceiving father of a deceitful son.

LUCENTIO  And what of him?

BIONDELLO  His daughter is to be brought by you to the
supper.

LUCENTIO  And then?

BIONDELLO  The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at
your command at all hours.

LUCENTIO  And what of all this?

BIONDELLO  I cannot tell, except they are busied
about a counterfeit assurance. Take you assurance
of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum. To th'
church take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
honest witnesses.
If this be not that you look for, I have no more to
But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.

LUCENTIO  Hear'st thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO  I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in
an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley
to stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir. And so adieu,
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against
you come with your appendix.	[He exits.]

I may, and will, if she be so contented.
She will be pleased. Then wherefore should I
doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her.
It shall go hard if "Cambio" go without her.

[A tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.
Enter a Shipmaster and a Boatswain.]

MASTER  Boatswain!

BOATSWAIN  Here, master. What cheer?

MASTER  Good, speak to th' mariners. Fall to 't yarely,
or we run ourselves aground. Bestir, bestir!

[Enter Mariners.]

BOATSWAIN  Heigh, my hearts! Cheerly, cheerly, my
hearts! Yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to th'
Master's whistle.--Blow till thou burst thy wind, if
room enough!

[Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Ferdinand, Gonzalo,
and others.]

ALONSO  Good boatswain, have care. Where's the Master?
Play the men.

BOATSWAIN  I pray now, keep below.

ANTONIO  Where is the Master, boatswain?

BOATSWAIN  Do you not hear him? You mar our labor.
Keep your cabins. You do assist the storm.

GONZALO  Nay, good, be patient.

BOATSWAIN  When the sea is. Hence! What cares these
roarers for the name of king? To cabin! Silence!
Trouble us not.

GONZALO  Good, yet remember whom thou hast
aboard.

BOATSWAIN  None that I more love than myself. You are
a councillor; if you can command these elements
to silence, and work the peace of the present, we
will not hand a rope more. Use your authority. If
you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and
make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance
of the hour, if it so hap.--Cheerly, good
hearts!--Out of our way, I say!	[He exits.]

GONZALO  I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks
he hath no drowning mark upon him. His
complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good
Fate, to his hanging. Make the rope of his destiny
our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be
not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
[He exits with Alonso, Sebastian,
and the other courtiers.]

[Enter Boatswain.]

BOATSWAIN  Down with the topmast! Yare! Lower, lower!
Bring her to try wi' th' main course. [(A cry
within.)] A plague upon this howling! They are
louder than the weather or our office.

[Enter Sebastian, Antonio, and Gonzalo.]

Yet again? What do you here? Shall we give o'er and
drown? Have you a mind to sink?

SEBASTIAN  A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!

BOATSWAIN  Work you, then.

ANTONIO  Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent
noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drowned than
thou art.

GONZALO  I'll warrant him for drowning, though the
ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky
as an unstanched wench.

BOATSWAIN  Lay her ahold, ahold! Set her two courses.
Off to sea again! Lay her off!

[Enter more Mariners, wet.]

MARINERS  All lost! To prayers, to prayers! All lost!
[Mariners exit.]

BOATSWAIN  What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO  The King and Prince at prayers. Let's assist
them, for our case is as theirs.

SEBASTIAN  I am out of patience.

ANTONIO  We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.
This wide-chopped rascal--would thou
mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides!
[Boatswain exits.]

GONZALO  He'll be hanged yet, though every drop of
water swear against it and gape at wid'st to glut him.

[A confused noise within:]  "Mercy on us!"--"We split, we
split!"--"Farewell, my wife and children!"--
"Farewell, brother!"--"We split, we split, we
split!"

ANTONIO  Let's all sink wi' th' King.

SEBASTIAN  Let's take leave of him.
[He exits with Antonio.]

GONZALO  Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea
for an acre of barren ground: long heath, brown
furze, anything. The wills above be done, but I
would fain die a dry death.


[Enter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise of
thunder heard.]

All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
By inchmeal a disease! His spirits hear me,
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' th' mire,
Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em. But
For every trifle are they set upon me,
Sometimes like apes, that mow and chatter at me
And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall. Sometime am I
All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness. Lo, now, lo!
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat.
Perchance he will not mind me.
[He lies down and covers himself with a cloak.]

[Enter Trinculo.]

TRINCULO  Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off
any weather at all. And another storm brewing; I
hear it sing i' th' wind. Yond same black cloud, yond
huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed
his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I
know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud
cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. [Noticing Caliban.]
What have we here, a man or a fish? Dead or
alive? A fish, he smells like a fish--a very ancient
and fishlike smell, a kind of not-of-the-newest poor-John.
A strange fish. Were I in England now, as once
I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday
fool there but would give a piece of silver. There
would this monster make a man. Any strange beast
there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to
relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a
dead Indian. Legged like a man, and his fins like
arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now let loose my
opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an
islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt.
[Thunder.] Alas, the storm is come again. My best
way is to creep under his gaberdine. There is no
other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man
with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the
dregs of the storm be past.
[He crawls under Caliban's cloak.]

[Enter Stephano singing.]

STEPHANO
	I shall no more to sea, to sea.
	Here shall I die ashore--
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral.
Well, here's my comfort.	[Drinks.]

	The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,
	   The gunner and his mate,
	Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,
	   But none of us cared for Kate.
	      For she had a tongue with a tang,
	      Would cry to a sailor "Go hang!"
	She loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch,
	Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch.
	      Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
This is a scurvy tune too. But here's my comfort.
[Drinks.]

CALIBAN  Do not torment me! O!

STEPHANO  What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do
you put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind?
Ha? I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now
of your four legs, for it hath been said "As proper a
man as ever went on four legs cannot make him
give ground," and it shall be said so again while
Stephano breathes at' nostrils.

CALIBAN  The spirit torments me. O!

STEPHANO  This is some monster of the isle with four
legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the
devil should he learn our language? I will give him
some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him,
he's a present for any emperor that ever trod on
neat's leather.

CALIBAN  Do not torment me, prithee. I'll bring my
wood home faster.

STEPHANO  He's in his fit now, and does not talk after
the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle. If he have
never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove
his fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
not take too much for him. He shall pay for him that
hath him, and that soundly.

CALIBAN  Thou dost me yet but little hurt. Thou wilt
anon; I know it by thy trembling. Now Prosper
works upon thee.

STEPHANO  Come on your ways. Open your mouth.
Here is that which will give language to you, cat.
Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I
can tell you, and that soundly. [Caliban drinks.] You
cannot tell who's your friend. Open your chaps

TRINCULO  I should know that voice. It should be--but
he is drowned, and these are devils. O, defend me!

STEPHANO  Four legs and two voices--a most delicate
monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of
his friend. His backward voice is to utter foul
speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle
will recover him, I will help his ague. Come.
[Caliban drinks.] Amen! I will pour some in thy
other mouth.

TRINCULO  Stephano!

STEPHANO  Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy,
this is a devil, and no monster! I will leave him; I
have no long spoon.

TRINCULO  Stephano! If thou be'st Stephano, touch me
and speak to me, for I am Trinculo--be not
afeard--thy good friend Trinculo.

STEPHANO  If thou be'st Trinculo, come forth. I'll pull
thee by the lesser legs. If any be Trinculo's legs,
these are they. [He pulls him out from under Caliban's
cloak.] Thou art very Trinculo indeed. How
cam'st thou to be the siege of this mooncalf? Can
he vent Trinculos?

TRINCULO  I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke.
But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I
hope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm
overblown? I hid me under the dead mooncalf's
gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living,
Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped!

STEPHANO  Prithee, do not turn me about. My stomach
is not constant.

CALIBAN, [aside]  These be fine things, an if they be not
sprites. That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
I will kneel to him.
[He crawls out from under the cloak.]

STEPHANO, [to Trinculo]  How didst thou scape? How
cam'st thou hither? Swear by this bottle how thou
cam'st hither--I escaped upon a butt of sack, which
the sailors heaved o'erboard--by this bottle, which
I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands,
since I was cast ashore.

CALIBAN  I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true
subject, for the liquor is not earthly.

STEPHANO, [to Trinculo]  Here. Swear then how thou
escapedst.

TRINCULO  Swum ashore, man, like a duck. I can swim
like a duck, I'll be sworn.

STEPHANO  Here, kiss the book.	[Trinculo drinks.]
Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made
like a goose.

TRINCULO  O Stephano, hast any more of this?

STEPHANO  The whole butt, man. My cellar is in a rock
by th' seaside, where my wine is hid.--How now,
mooncalf, how does thine ague?

CALIBAN  Hast thou not dropped from heaven?

STEPHANO  Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee. I was the
man i' th' moon when time was.

CALIBAN  I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee.
My mistress showed me thee, and thy dog, and thy
bush.

STEPHANO  Come, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will
furnish it anon with new contents. Swear.

TRINCULO  By this good light, this is a very shallow
monster. I afeard of him? A very weak monster. The
man i' th' moon? A most poor, credulous monster!
--Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!

CALIBAN  I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island,
and I will kiss thy foot. I prithee, be my god.

TRINCULO  By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
monster. When 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.

CALIBAN  I'll kiss thy foot. I'll swear myself thy subject.

STEPHANO  Come on, then. Down, and swear.
[Caliban kneels.]

TRINCULO  I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
monster. A most scurvy monster. I could
find in my heart to beat him--

STEPHANO  Come, kiss.

TRINCULO  --but that the poor monster's in drink. An
abominable monster.

I'll show thee the best springs. I'll pluck thee berries.
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve.
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
Thou wondrous man.

TRINCULO  A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder
of a poor drunkard.

CALIBAN, [standing]
I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow,
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts,
Show thee a jay's nest, and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset. I'll bring thee
To clustering filberts, and sometimes I'll get thee
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

STEPHANO  I prithee now, lead the way without any
more talking.--Trinculo, the King and all our
company else being drowned, we will inherit here.
--Here, bear my bottle.--Fellow Trinculo, we'll
fill him by and by again.

CALIBAN [sings drunkenly]
	Farewell, master, farewell, farewell.

TRINCULO  A howling monster, a drunken monster.

CALIBAN [sings]
	No more dams I'll make for fish,
	   Nor fetch in firing
	   At requiring,
	Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish.
	   'Ban, 'ban, Ca-caliban
	   Has a new master. Get a new man.
Freedom, high-day! High-day, freedom! Freedom,
high-day, freedom!

STEPHANO  O brave monster! Lead the way.

[Enter Valentine and Proteus.]

Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus.
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
Were 't not affection chains thy tender days
To the sweet glances of thy honored love,
I rather would entreat thy company
To see the wonders of the world abroad
Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
But since thou lov'st, love still and thrive therein,
Even as I would when I to love begin.

Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu.
Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest
Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
If ever danger do environ thee,
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.

And on a love-book pray for my success?

Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.

That's on some shallow story of deep love,
How young Leander crossed the Hellespont.

That's a deep story of a deeper love,
For he was more than over shoes in love.

'Tis true, for you are over boots in love,
And yet you never swam the Hellespont.

Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.

No, I will not, for it boots thee not.

PROTEUS  What?

To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading
moment's mirth
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights;
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
If lost, why then a grievous labor won;
How ever, but a folly bought with wit,
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.

So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.

So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.

'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.

Love is your master, for he masters you;
And he that is so yoked by a fool
Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.

Yet writers say: as in the sweetest bud
The eating canker dwells, so eating love
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.

And writers say: as the most forward bud
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
Even so by love the young and tender wit
Is turned to folly, blasting in the bud,
Losing his verdure, even in the prime,
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee
That art a votary to fond desire?
Once more adieu. My father at the road
Expects my coming, there to see me shipped.

And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.

Sweet Proteus, no. Now let us take our leave.
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Of thy success in love, and what news else
Betideth here in absence of thy friend.
And I likewise will visit thee with mine.

All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.

As much to you at home. And so farewell.	[He exits.]

He after honor hunts, I after love.
He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;
I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.


Sir Proteus, 'save you. Saw you my master?

But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.

Twenty to one, then, he is shipped already,
And I have played the sheep in losing him.

Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
An if the shepherd be awhile away.

SPEED  You conclude that my master is a shepherd,
then, and I a sheep?

PROTEUS  I do.

SPEED  Why, then my horns are his horns, whether I
wake or sleep.

PROTEUS  A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.

SPEED  This proves me still a sheep.

PROTEUS  True, and thy master a shepherd.

SPEED  Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.

PROTEUS  It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.

SPEED  The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the
sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my
master seeks not me. Therefore I am no sheep.

PROTEUS  The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
shepherd for food follows not the sheep. Thou for
wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
follows not thee. Therefore thou art a sheep.

SPEED  Such another proof will make me cry "baa."

PROTEUS  But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to
Julia?

SPEED  Ay, sir. I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a
laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
lost mutton, nothing for my labor.

PROTEUS  Here's too small a pasture for such store of
muttons.

SPEED  If the ground be overcharged, you were best
stick her.

PROTEUS  Nay, in that you are astray; 'twere best pound

SPEED  Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
carrying your letter.

PROTEUS  You mistake; I mean the pound, a pinfold.

From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your
lover.

PROTEUS  But what said she?

SPEED, [nodding]  Ay.

PROTEUS  Nod--"Ay." Why, that's "noddy."

SPEED  You mistook, sir. I say she did nod, and you ask
me if she did nod, and I say "ay."

PROTEUS  And that set together is "noddy."

SPEED  Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
take it for your pains.

PROTEUS  No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.

SPEED  Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.

PROTEUS  Why, sir, how do you bear with me?

SPEED  Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing
but the word "noddy" for my pains.

PROTEUS  Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.

SPEED  And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.

PROTEUS  Come, come, open the matter in brief. What
said she?

SPEED  Open your purse, that the money and the matter
may be both at once delivered.

PROTEUS, [giving money]  Well, sir, here is for your
pains. What said she?

SPEED, [looking at the money]  Truly, sir, I think you'll
hardly win her.

PROTEUS  Why? Couldst thou perceive so much from

SPEED  Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her, no,
not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter.
And being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your mind.
Give her no token but stones, for she's as hard as
steel.

PROTEUS  What said she? Nothing?

SPEED  No, not so much as "Take this for thy pains."
To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have
testerned me. In requital whereof, henceforth
carry your letters yourself. And so, sir, I'll commend
you to my master.

Go, go, begone, to save your ship from wrack,
Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
Being destined to a drier death on shore.
[Speed exits.]
I must go send some better messenger.
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
Receiving them from such a worthless post.

[Enter Lance, weeping, with his dog, Crab.]

LANCE  Nay,'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping.
All the kind of the Lances have this very fault. I have
received my proportion like the Prodigious Son and
am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's court. I
think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured dog that
lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my
sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing
her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity,
yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He
is a stone, a very pibble stone, and has no more pity
in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have
seen our parting. Why, my grandam, having no
eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting.
Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. [He takes off his
shoes.] This shoe is my father. No, this left shoe is
my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother. Nay,
that cannot be so neither. Yes, it is so, it is so; it hath
the worser sole. This shoe with the hole in it is my
mother; and this my father. A vengeance on 't, there
'tis! Now sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she
is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat
is Nan, our maid. I am the dog. No, the dog is
himself, and I am the dog. O, the dog is me, and I
am myself. Ay, so, so. Now come I to my father:
"Father, your blessing." Now should not the shoe
speak a word for weeping. Now should I kiss my
father. [He kisses one shoe.] Well, he weeps on. Now
come I to my mother. O, that she could speak now
like a wold woman! Well, I kiss her. [He kisses the
other shoe.] Why, there 'tis; here's my mother's
breath up and down. Now come I to my sister. Mark
the moan she makes! Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear nor speaks a word. But see how I
lay the dust with my tears.


PANTINO  Lance, away, away! Aboard. Thy master is
shipped, and thou art to post after with oars. What's
the matter? Why weep'st thou, man? Away, ass.
You'll lose the tide if you tarry any longer.

LANCE  It is no matter if the tied were lost, for it is the
unkindest tied that ever any man tied.

PANTINO  What's the unkindest tide?

LANCE  Why, he that's tied here, Crab my dog.

PANTINO  Tut, man. I mean thou 'lt lose the flood and, in
losing the flood, lose thy voyage and, in losing thy
voyage, lose thy master and, in losing thy master,
lose thy service and, in losing thy service--[Lance
covers Pantino's mouth.] Why dost thou stop my
mouth?

LANCE  For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.

PANTINO  Where should I lose my tongue?

LANCE  In thy tale.

PANTINO  In thy tail!

LANCE  Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master,
and the service, and the tied. Why, man, if the river
were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the
wind were down, I could drive the boat with my
sighs.

PANTINO  Come. Come away, man. I was sent to call

LANCE  Sir, call me what thou dar'st.

PANTINO  Wilt thou go?

LANCE  Well, I will go.


The sun begins to gild the western sky,
And now it is about the very hour
That Sylvia at Friar Patrick's cell should meet me.
She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
Unless it be to come before their time,
So much they spur their expedition.


See where she comes.--Lady, a happy evening.

Amen, amen. Go on, good Eglamour,
Out at the postern by the abbey wall.
I fear I am attended by some spies.

Fear not. The forest is not three leagues off;
If we recover that, we are sure enough.

[Enter Thurio, Proteus, and Julia, disguised as

Sir Proteus, what says Sylvia to my suit?

O sir, I find her milder than she was,
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.

THURIO  What? That my leg is too long?

PROTEUS  No, that it is too little.

I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.

But love will not be spurred to what it loathes.

THURIO  What says she to my face?

PROTEUS  She says it is a fair one.

Nay, then the wanton lies; my face is black.

But pearls are fair, and the old saying is,
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.

'Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies' eyes,
For I had rather wink than look on them.

THURIO  How likes she my discourse?

PROTEUS  Ill, when you talk of war.

But well when I discourse of love and peace.

But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.

THURIO  What says she to my valor?

PROTEUS  O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.

She needs not when she knows it cowardice.

THURIO  What says she to my birth?

PROTEUS  That you are well derived.

JULIA, [aside]  True, from a gentleman to a fool.

THURIO  Considers she my possessions?

PROTEUS  O, ay, and pities them.

THURIO  Wherefore?

JULIA, [aside]  That such an ass should owe them.

That they are out by lease.

JULIA, [as Sebastian]  Here comes the Duke.


How now, Sir Proteus?--How now, Thurio?
Which of you saw Eglamour of late?

Not I.

PROTEUS  Nor I.

DUKE  Saw you my daughter?

PROTEUS  Neither.

Why, then, she's fled unto that peasant, Valentine,
And Eglamour is in her company.
'Tis true, for Friar Lawrence met them both
As he, in penance, wandered through the forest;
Him he knew well and guessed that it was she,
But, being masked, he was not sure of it.
Besides, she did intend confession
At Patrick's cell this even, and there she was not.
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse,
But mount you presently and meet with me
Upon the rising of the mountain foot
That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.

Why, this it is to be a peevish girl
That flies her fortune when it follows her.
I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
Than for the love of reckless Sylvia.	[He exits.]

And I will follow, more for Sylvia's love
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.

And I will follow, more to cross that love
Than hate for Sylvia, that is gone for love.

[Enter Pirithous, Hippolyta, Emilia.]

No further.

HIPPOLYTA  Sir, farewell. Repeat my wishes
To our great lord, of whose success I dare not
Make any timorous question; yet I wish him
Excess and overflow of power, an 't might be,
To dure ill-dealing fortune. Speed to him.
Store never hurts good governors.

PIRITHOUS  Though I know
His ocean needs not my poor drops, yet they
Must yield their tribute there.--My precious maid,
Those best affections that the heavens infuse
In their best-tempered pieces keep enthroned
In your dear heart!

EMILIA  Thanks, sir. Remember me
To our all-royal brother, for whose speed
The great Bellona I'll solicit; and
Since in our terrene state petitions are not
Without gifts understood, I'll offer to her
What I shall be advised she likes. Our hearts
Are in his army, in his tent.

HIPPOLYTA  In 's bosom.
We have been soldiers, and we cannot weep
When our friends don their helms or put to sea,
Or tell of babes broached on the lance, or women
That have sod their infants in--and after ate them--
The brine they wept at killing 'em. Then if
You stay to see of us such spinsters, we
Should hold you here forever.

PIRITHOUS  Peace be to you
As I pursue this war, which shall be then
Beyond further requiring.	[Pirithous exits.]

EMILIA  How his longing
Follows his friend! Since his depart, his sports,
Though craving seriousness and skill, passed slightly
His careless execution, where nor gain
Made him regard, or loss consider, but
Playing one business in his hand, another
Directing in his head, his mind nurse equal
To these so diff'ring twins. Have you observed him
Since our great lord departed?

HIPPOLYTA  With much labor,
And I did love him for 't. They two have cabined
In many as dangerous as poor a corner,
Peril and want contending; they have skiffed
Torrents whose roaring tyranny and power
I' th' least of these was dreadful, and they have
Fought out together where Death's self was lodged.
Yet fate hath brought them off. Their knot of love,
Tied, weaved, entangled, with so true, so long,
And with a finger of so deep a cunning,
May be outworn, never undone. I think
Theseus cannot be umpire to himself,
Cleaving his conscience into twain and doing
Each side like justice, which he loves best.

EMILIA  Doubtless
There is a best, and reason has no manners
To say it is not you. I was acquainted
Once with a time when I enjoyed a playfellow;
You were at wars when she the grave enriched,
Who made too proud the bed; took leave o' th' moon,
Which then looked pale at parting, when our count
Was each eleven.

HIPPOLYTA  'Twas Flavina.

EMILIA  Yes.
You talk of Pirithous' and Theseus' love.
Theirs has more ground, is more maturely seasoned,
More buckled with strong judgment, and their needs
The one of th' other may be said to water
Their intertangled roots of love. But I,
And she I sigh and spoke of, were things innocent,
Loved for we did, and like the elements
That know not what nor why, yet do effect
Rare issues by their operance, our souls
Did so to one another. What she liked
Was then of me approved, what not, condemned,
No more arraignment. The flower that I would pluck
And put between my breasts--O, then but beginning
To swell about the blossom--she would long
Till she had such another, and commit it
To the like innocent cradle, where, Phoenix-like,
They died in perfume. On my head no toy
But was her pattern; her affections--pretty,
Though haply hers careless were--I followed
For my most serious decking. Had mine ear
Stol'n some new air, or at adventure hummed one
From musical coinage, why, it was a note
Whereon her spirits would sojourn--rather, dwell
on--
And sing it in her slumbers. This rehearsal--
Which fury-innocent wots well comes in
Like old importment's bastard--has this end,
That the true love 'tween maid and maid may be
More than in sex individual.

HIPPOLYTA  You're out of breath,
And this high-speeded pace is but to say
That you shall never--like the maid Flavina--
Love any that's called man.

EMILIA  I am sure I shall not.

HIPPOLYTA  Now, alack, weak sister,
I must no more believe thee in this point--
Though in 't I know thou dost believe thyself--
Than I will trust a sickly appetite,
That loathes even as it longs. But sure, my sister,
If I were ripe for your persuasion, you
Have said enough to shake me from the arm
Of the all-noble Theseus, for whose fortunes
I will now in and kneel, with great assurance
That we, more than his Pirithous, possess
The high throne in his heart.

EMILIA  I am not
Against your faith, yet I continue mine.

[Enter Palamon from the bush.]

About this hour my cousin gave his faith
To visit me again, and with him bring
Two swords and two good armors. If he fail,
He's neither man nor soldier. When he left me,
I did not think a week could have restored
My lost strength to me, I was grown so low
And crestfall'n with my wants. I thank thee, Arcite,
Thou art yet a fair foe, and I feel myself,
With this refreshing, able once again
To outdure danger. To delay it longer
Would make the world think, when it comes to
hearing,
That I lay fatting like a swine to fight
And not a soldier. Therefore, this blest morning
Shall be the last; and that sword he refuses,
If it but hold, I kill him with. 'Tis justice.
So, love and fortune for me!

[Enter Arcite with armors and swords.]

O, good morrow.

Good morrow, noble kinsman.

PALAMON  I have put you
To too much pains, sir.

ARCITE  That too much, fair cousin,
Is but a debt to honor and my duty.

Would you were so in all, sir; I could wish you
As kind a kinsman as you force me find
A beneficial foe, that my embraces
Might thank you, not my blows.

ARCITE  I shall think either,
Well done, a noble recompense.

PALAMON  Then I shall quit you.

Defy me in these fair terms, and you show
More than a mistress to me. No more anger,
As you love anything that's honorable!
We were not bred to talk, man; when we are armed
And both upon our guards, then let our fury,
Like meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us,
And then to whom the birthright of this beauty
Truly pertains--without upbraidings, scorns,
Despisings of our persons, and such poutings,
Fitter for girls and schoolboys--will be seen,
And quickly, yours or mine. Will 't please you arm,
Or if you feel yourself not fitting yet
And furnished with your old strength, I'll stay,
And ev'ry day discourse you into health,
As I am spared. Your person I am friends with,
And I could wish I had not said I loved her,
Though I had died. But loving such a lady,
And justifying my love, I must not fly from 't.

Arcite, thou art so brave an enemy
That no man but thy cousin's fit to kill thee.
I am well and lusty. Choose your arms.

ARCITE  Choose you, sir.

Wilt thou exceed in all, or dost thou do it
To make me spare thee?

ARCITE  If you think so, cousin,
You are deceived, for as I am a soldier,
I will not spare you.

PALAMON  That's well said.

ARCITE  You'll find it.

Then, as I am an honest man and love
With all the justice of affection,
I'll pay thee soundly.	[He chooses armor.]
This I'll take.

ARCITE [taking the other]  That's mine, then.
I'll arm you first.

PALAMON  Do.	[Arcite begins arming him.]
Pray thee tell me, cousin,
Where got'st thou this good armor?

ARCITE  'Tis the Duke's,
And to say true, I stole it. Do I pinch you?

PALAMON  No.

Is 't not too heavy?

PALAMON  I have worn a lighter,
But I shall make it serve.

ARCITE  I'll buckle 't close.

By any means.

ARCITE  You care not for a grand guard?

No, no, we'll use no horses. I perceive
You would fain be at that fight.

ARCITE  I am indifferent.

Faith, so am I. Good cousin, thrust the buckle
Through far enough.

ARCITE  I warrant you.

PALAMON  My casque now.

Will you fight bare-armed?

PALAMON  We shall be the nimbler.

But use your gauntlets though. Those are o' th' least.
Prithee take mine, good cousin.

PALAMON  Thank you, Arcite.
How do I look? Am I fall'n much away?

Faith, very little; love has used you kindly.

I'll warrant thee, I'll strike home.

ARCITE  Do, and spare not.
I'll give you cause, sweet cousin.

PALAMON  Now to you, sir.
[He begins to arm Arcite.]
Methinks this armor's very like that, Arcite,
Thou wor'st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.

That was a very good one, and that day,
I well remember, you outdid me, cousin.
I never saw such valor. When you charged
Upon the left wing of the enemy,
I spurred hard to come up, and under me
I had a right good horse.

PALAMON  You had, indeed;
A bright bay, I remember.

ARCITE  Yes, but all
Was vainly labored in me; you outwent me,
Nor could my wishes reach you; yet a little
I did by imitation.

PALAMON  More by virtue;
You are modest, cousin.

ARCITE  When I saw you charge first,
Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder
Break from the troop.

PALAMON  But still before that flew
The lightning of your valor. Stay a little;
Is not this piece too strait?

ARCITE  No, no, 'tis well.

I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword.
A bruise would be dishonor.

ARCITE  Now I am perfect.

Stand off, then.

ARCITE  Take my sword; I hold it better.

I thank you, no; keep it; your life lies on it.
Here's one; if it but hold, I ask no more
For all my hopes. My cause and honor guard me!

And me my love!
[They bow several ways, then advance and stand.]
Is there aught else to say?

This only, and no more: thou art mine aunt's son.
And that blood we desire to shed is mutual--
In me thine, and in thee mine. My sword
Is in my hand, and if thou kill'st me,
The gods and I forgive thee. If there be
A place prepared for those that sleep in honor,
I wish his weary soul that falls may win it.
Fight bravely, cousin. Give me thy noble hand.

ARCITE, [as they shake hands]
Here, Palamon. This hand shall never more
Come near thee with such friendship.

PALAMON  I commend thee.

If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward,
For none but such dare die in these just trials.
Once more farewell, my cousin.

PALAMON  Farewell, Arcite.
[Fight.]
[Horns within. They stand.]

Lo, cousin, lo, our folly has undone us!

PALAMON  Why?

This is the Duke, a-hunting, as I told you.
If we be found, we are wretched. O, retire,
For honor's sake, and safely, presently
Into your bush again. Sir, we shall find
Too many hours to die in. Gentle cousin,
If you be seen, you perish instantly
For breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,
For my contempt. Then all the world will scorn us,
And say we had a noble difference,
But base disposers of it.

PALAMON  No, no, cousin,
I will no more be hidden, nor put off
This great adventure to a second trial.
I know your cunning, and I know your cause.
He that faints now, shame take him! Put thyself
Upon thy present guard--

ARCITE  You are not mad?

Or I will make th' advantage of this hour
Mine own, and what to come shall threaten me
I fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,
I love Emilia, and in that I'll bury
Thee and all crosses else.

ARCITE  Then come what can come,
Thou shalt know, Palamon, I dare as well
Die as discourse or sleep. Only this fears me:
The law will have the honor of our ends.
Have at thy life!

PALAMON  Look to thine own well, Arcite.
[Fight again.]

[Horns. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia,
Pirithous and train.]

What ignorant and mad malicious traitors
Are you, that 'gainst the tenor of my laws
Are making battle, thus like knights appointed,
Without my leave and officers of arms?
By Castor, both shall die.

PALAMON  Hold thy word, Theseus.
We are certainly both traitors, both despisers
Of thee and of thy goodness. I am Palamon,
That cannot love thee, he that broke thy prison.
Think well what that deserves. And this is Arcite.
A bolder traitor never trod thy ground,
A falser ne'er seemed friend. This is the man
Was begged and banished; this is he contemns thee
And what thou dar'st do; and in this disguise,
Against thine own edict, follows thy sister,
That fortunate bright star, the fair Emilia,
Whose servant--if there be a right in seeing
And first bequeathing of the soul to--justly
I am; and, which is more, dares think her his.
This treachery, like a most trusty lover,
I called him now to answer. If thou be'st
As thou art spoken, great and virtuous,
The true decider of all injuries,
Say "Fight again," and thou shalt see me, Theseus,
Do such a justice thou thyself wilt envy.
Then take my life; I'll woo thee to 't.

PIRITHOUS  O heaven,
What more than man is this!

THESEUS  I have sworn.

ARCITE  We seek not
Thy breath of mercy, Theseus. 'Tis to me
A thing as soon to die as thee to say it,
And no more moved. Where this man calls me
traitor,
Let me say thus much: if in love be treason,
In service of so excellent a beauty,
As I love most, and in that faith will perish,
As I have brought my life here to confirm it,
As I have served her truest, worthiest,
As I dare kill this cousin that denies it,
So let me be most traitor, and you please me.
For scorning thy edict, duke, ask that lady
Why she is fair, and why her eyes command me
Stay here to love her; and if she say "traitor,"
I am a villain fit to lie unburied.

Thou shalt have pity of us both, O Theseus,
If unto neither thou show mercy. Stop,
As thou art just, thy noble ear against us;
As thou art valiant, for thy cousin's soul,
Whose twelve strong labors crown his memory,
Let's die together at one instant, duke;
Only a little let him fall before me,
That I may tell my soul he shall not have her.

I grant your wish, for to say true, your cousin
Has ten times more offended, for I gave him
More mercy than you found, sir, your offenses
Being no more than his.--None here speak for 'em,
For ere the sun set both shall sleep forever.

Alas, the pity! Now or never, sister,
Speak not to be denied. That face of yours
Will bear the curses else of after ages
For these lost cousins.

EMILIA  In my face, dear sister,
I find no anger to 'em, nor no ruin.
The misadventure of their own eyes kill 'em.
Yet that I will be woman and have pity,
My knees shall grow to th' ground but I'll get mercy.
Help me, dear sister; in a deed so virtuous,
The powers of all women will be with us.
[Hippolyta kneels.]
Most royal brother--

HIPPOLYTA  Sir, by our tie of marriage--

By your own spotless honor--

HIPPOLYTA  By that faith,
That fair hand, and that honest heart you gave me--

By that you would have pity in another;
By your own virtues infinite--

HIPPOLYTA  By valor;
By all the chaste nights I have ever pleased you--

These are strange conjurings.

PIRITHOUS  Nay, then, I'll in too.
By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers;
By all you love most, wars and this sweet lady--

By that you would have trembled to deny
A blushing maid--

HIPPOLYTA  By your own eyes; by strength,
In which you swore I went beyond all women,
Almost all men, and yet I yielded, Theseus--

To crown all this: by your most noble soul,
Which cannot want due mercy, I beg first--

Next hear my prayers--

EMILIA  Last let me entreat, sir--

For mercy.

HIPPOLYTA  Mercy.

EMILIA  Mercy on these princes.

You make my faith reel. [(To Emilia.)] Say I felt
Compassion to 'em both, how would you place it?
[They rise from their knees.]

Upon their lives, but with their banishments.

You are a right woman, sister: you have pity,
But want the understanding where to use it.
If you desire their lives, invent a way
Safer than banishment. Can these two live,
And have the agony of love about 'em,
And not kill one another? Every day
They'd fight about you, hourly bring your honor
In public question with their swords. Be wise, then,
And here forget 'em; it concerns your credit
And my oath equally. I have said they die.
Better they fall by th' law than one another.
Bow not my honor.

EMILIA  O, my noble brother,
That oath was rashly made, and in your anger;
Your reason will not hold it. If such vows
Stand for express will, all the world must perish.
Besides, I have another oath 'gainst yours,
Of more authority, I am sure more love,
Not made in passion neither, but good heed.

What is it, sister?

PIRITHOUS  Urge it home, brave lady.

That you would ne'er deny me anything
Fit for my modest suit and your free granting.
I tie you to your word now; if you fail in 't,
Think how you maim your honor--
For now I am set a-begging, sir, I am deaf
To all but your compassion--how their lives
Might breed the ruin of my name. Opinion!
Shall anything that loves me perish for me?
That were a cruel wisdom. Do men prune
The straight young boughs that blush with thousand
blossoms
Because they may be rotten? O, Duke Theseus,
The goodly mothers that have groaned for these,
And all the longing maids that ever loved,
If your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty,
And in their funeral songs for these two cousins
Despise my cruelty, and cry woe worth me,
Till I am nothing but the scorn of women.
For heaven's sake, save their lives, and banish 'em.

On what conditions?

EMILIA  Swear 'em never more
To make me their contention, or to know me,
To tread upon thy dukedom, and to be,
Wherever they shall travel, ever strangers
To one another.

PALAMON  I'll be cut a-pieces
Before I take this oath! Forget I love her?
O, all you gods, despise me then! Thy banishment
I not mislike, so we may fairly carry
Our swords and cause along; else never trifle,
But take our lives, duke. I must love, and will,
And for that love must and dare kill this cousin
On any piece the Earth has.

THESEUS  Will you, Arcite,
Take these conditions?

PALAMON  He's a villain, then.

PIRITHOUS  These are men!

No, never, duke. 'Tis worse to me than begging
To take my life so basely; though I think
I never shall enjoy her, yet I'll preserve
The honor of affection, and die for her,
Make death a devil!

What may be done? For now I feel compassion.

Let it not fall again, sir.

THESEUS  Say, Emilia,
If one of them were dead, as one must, are you
Content to take th' other to your husband?
They cannot both enjoy you. They are princes
As goodly as your own eyes, and as noble
As ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon 'em,
And, if you can love, end this difference.
I give consent.--Are you content too, princes?

With all our souls.

THESEUS  He that she refuses
Must die then.

BOTH  Any death thou canst invent, duke.

If I fall from that mouth, I fall with favor,
And lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes.

If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,
And soldiers sing my epitaph.

THESEUS, [to Emilia]  Make choice, then.

I cannot, sir; they are both too excellent.
For me, a hair shall never fall of these men.

What will become of 'em?

THESEUS  Thus I ordain it--
And, by mine honor, once again, it stands,
Or both shall die: you shall both to your country,
And each within this month, accompanied
With three fair knights, appear again in this place,
In which I'll plant a pyramid; and whether,
Before us that are here, can force his cousin
By fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar,
He shall enjoy her; the other lose his head,
And all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,
Nor think he dies with interest in this lady.
Will this content you?

PALAMON  Yes.--Here, Cousin Arcite,
I am friends again till that hour.	[He offers his hand.]

ARCITE  I embrace you.

Are you content, sister?

EMILIA  Yes, I must, sir,
Else both miscarry.

THESEUS, [to Palamon and Arcite]
Come, shake hands again, then,
And take heed, as you are gentlemen, this quarrel
Sleep till the hour prefixed, and hold your course.

We dare not fail thee, Theseus.
[They shake hands again.]

THESEUS  Come, I'll give you
Now usage like to princes and to friends.
When you return, who wins I'll settle here;
Who loses, yet I'll weep upon his bier.

[Enter Guard with Palamon and his Knights,
pinioned; Jailer, Executioner and Others,
carrying a block and an ax.]

There's many a man alive that hath outlived
The love o' th' people; yea, i' th' selfsame state
Stands many a father with his child. Some comfort
We have by so considering. We expire,
And not without men's pity. To live still,
Have their good wishes; we prevent
The loathsome misery of age, beguile
The gout and rheum that in lag hours attend
For gray approachers; we come towards the gods
Young and unwappered, not halting under crimes
Many and stale. That sure shall please the gods
Sooner than such, to give us nectar with 'em,
For we are more clear spirits. My dear kinsmen,
Whose lives for this poor comfort are laid down,
You have sold 'em too too cheap.

FIRST KNIGHT  What ending could be
Of more content? O'er us the victors have
Fortune, whose title is as momentary
As to us death is certain. A grain of honor
They not o'er-weigh us.

SECOND KNIGHT  Let us bid farewell;
And with our patience anger tott'ring Fortune,
Who at her certain'st reels.

THIRD KNIGHT  Come, who begins?

E'en he that led you to this banquet shall
Taste to you all. [To Jailer.] Ah ha, my friend, my
Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once;
You'll see 't done now forever. Pray, how does she?
I heard she was not well; her kind of ill
Gave me some sorrow.

JAILER  Sir, she's well restored,
And to be married shortly.

PALAMON  By my short life,
I am most glad on 't. 'Tis the latest thing
I shall be glad of; prithee, tell her so.
Commend me to her, and to piece her portion,
Tender her this.	[He gives his purse to Jailer.]

FIRST KNIGHT  Nay, let's be offerers all.

Is it a maid?

PALAMON  Verily, I think so.
A right good creature, more to me deserving
Than I can quit or speak of.

ALL KNIGHTS  Commend us to her.
[They give their purses.]

The gods requite you all and make her thankful!

Adieu, and let my life be now as short
As my leave-taking.	[Lays his head on the block.]

FIRST KNIGHT  Lead, courageous cousin.

SECOND AND THIRD KNIGHTS  We'll follow cheerfully.

[A great noise within crying "Run!" "Save!" "Hold!"
Enter in haste a Messenger.]

Hold, hold! O, hold, hold, hold!

[Enter Pirithous in haste.]

Hold, ho! It is a cursed haste you made
If you have done so quickly!--Noble Palamon,
The gods will show their glory in a life
That thou art yet to lead.

PALAMON  Can that be,
When Venus, I have said, is false? How do things
fare?

Arise, great sir, and give the tidings ear
That are most dearly sweet and bitter.

PALAMON, [rising]  What
Hath waked us from our dream?

PIRITHOUS  List then: your
Mounted upon a steed that Emily
Did first bestow on him--a black one, owing
Not a hair worth of white, which some will say
Weakens his price, and many will not buy
His goodness with this note, which superstition
Here finds allowance--on this horse is Arcite
Trotting the stones of Athens--which the calkins
Did rather tell than trample, for the horse
Would make his length a mile, if 't pleased his rider
To put pride in him. As he thus went counting
The flinty pavement, dancing, as 'twere, to th' music
His own hooves made--for, as they say, from iron
Came music's origin--what envious flint,
Cold as old Saturn, and like him possessed
With fire malevolent, darted a spark,
Or what fierce sulphur else, to this end made,
I comment not; the hot horse, hot as fire,
Took toy at this and fell to what disorder
His power could give his will; bounds, comes on end,
Forgets school-doing, being therein trained
And of kind manage. Pig-like he whines
At the sharp rowel, which he frets at rather
Than any jot obeys; seeks all foul means
Of boist'rous and rough jadery to disseat
His lord that kept it bravely. When naught served,
When neither curb would crack, girth break, nor
diff'ring plunges
Disroot his rider whence he grew, but that
He kept him 'tween his legs, on his hind hoofs
On end he stands
That Arcite's legs, being higher than his head,
Seemed with strange art to hang. His victor's wreath
Even then fell off his head, and presently
Backward the jade comes o'er, and his full poise
Becomes the rider's load. Yet is he living,
But such a vessel 'tis that floats but for
The surge that next approaches. He much desires
To have some speech with you. Lo, he appears.

[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia,
and Arcite carried in a chair.]

O, miserable end of our alliance!
The gods are mighty, Arcite. If thy heart,
Thy worthy, manly heart, be yet unbroken,
Give me thy last words. I am Palamon,
One that yet loves thee dying.

ARCITE  Take Emilia
And with her all the world's joy. Reach thy hand;
Farewell. I have told my last hour. I was false,
Yet never treacherous. Forgive me, cousin.
One kiss from fair Emilia.	[She kisses him.]
'Tis done.
Take her. I die.	[He dies.]

PALAMON  Thy brave soul seek Elysium!

I'll close thine eyes, prince. Blessed souls be with
Thou art a right good man, and while I live,
This day I give to tears.

PALAMON  And I to honor.

In this place first you fought; e'en very here
I sundered you. Acknowledge to the gods
Our thanks that you are living.
His part is played, and though it were too short,
He did it well. Your day is lengthened, and
The blissful dew of heaven does arrouse you.
The powerful Venus well hath graced her altar,
And given you your love. Our master, Mars,
Hath vouched his oracle, and to Arcite gave
The grace of the contention. So the deities
Have showed due justice.--Bear this hence.

PALAMON  O cousin,
That we should things desire which do cost us
The loss of our desire, that naught could buy
Dear love but loss of dear love.
[Arcite's body is carried out.]

THESEUS  Never Fortune
Did play a subtler game. The conquered triumphs;
The victor has the loss; yet in the passage
The gods have been most equal.--Palamon,
Your kinsman hath confessed the right o' th' lady
Did lie in you, for you first saw her and
Even then proclaimed your fancy. He restored her
As your stol'n jewel and desired your spirit
To send him hence forgiven. The gods my justice
Take from my hand and they themselves become
The executioners. Lead your lady off,
And call your lovers from the stage of death,
Whom I adopt my friends. A day or two
Let us look sadly, and give grace unto
The funeral of Arcite, in whose end
The visages of bridegrooms we'll put on
And smile with Palamon--for whom an hour,
But one hour since, I was as dearly sorry
As glad of Arcite, and am now as glad
As for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,
What things you make of us! For what we lack
We laugh, for what we have are sorry, still
Are children in some kind. Let us be thankful
For that which is, and with you leave dispute
That are above our question. Let's go off
And bear us like the time.


I would now ask you how you like the play,
But, as it is with schoolboys, cannot say.
I am cruel fearful! Pray yet, stay a while,
And let me look upon you. No man smile?
Then it goes hard, I see. He that has
Loved a young handsome wench, then, show his
face--
'Tis strange if none be here--and, if he will,
Against his conscience let him hiss and kill
Our market. 'Tis in vain, I see, to stay you.
Have at the worst can come, then! Now what say
And yet mistake me not: I am not bold.
We have no such cause. If the tale we have told--
For 'tis no other--any way content you--
For to that honest purpose it was meant you--
We have our end; and you shall have ere long,
I dare say, many a better, to prolong
Your old loves to us. We, and all our might,
Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.
[Flourish. He exits.]


[Enter Leontes, Lords, and Officers.]

This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
Of us too much beloved. Let us be cleared
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in justice, which shall have due course
Even to the guilt or the purgation.
Produce the prisoner.

It is his Highness' pleasure that the Queen
Appear in person here in court.

[Enter Hermione, as to her trial, Paulina, and Ladies.]

Silence!

LEONTES  Read the indictment.

OFFICER [reads]  Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes,
King of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned
of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes,
King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo
to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King, thy
royal husband; the pretense whereof being by circumstances
partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to
the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel
and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by

Since what I am to say must be but that
Which contradicts my accusation, and
The testimony on my part no other
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
To say "Not guilty." Mine integrity,
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Behold our human actions, as they do,
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
False accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
Whom least will seem to do so, my past life
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is more
Than history can pattern, though devised
And played to take spectators. For behold me,
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
To prate and talk for life and honor fore
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
As I weigh grief, which I would spare. For honor,
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
And only that I stand for. I appeal
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter so uncurrent I
Have strained t' appear thus; if one jot beyond
The bound of honor, or in act or will
That way inclining, hardened be the hearts
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
Cry fie upon my grave.

LEONTES  I ne'er heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to perform it first.

HERMIONE  That's true enough,
Though 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

You will not own it.

HERMIONE  More than mistress of
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
With whom I am accused, I do confess
I loved him as in honor he required,
With such a kind of love as might become
A lady like me, with a love even such,
So and no other, as yourself commanded,
Which not to have done, I think, had been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your friend, whose love had
spoke,
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
I know not how it tastes, though it be dished
For me to try how. All I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest man;
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

You knew of his departure, as you know
What you have underta'en to do in 's absence.

HERMIONE  Sir,
You speak a language that I understand not.
My life stands in the level of your dreams,
Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES  Your actions are my dreams.
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
And I but dreamed it. As you were past all shame--
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth,
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
No father owning it--which is indeed
More criminal in thee than it--so thou
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
Look for no less than death.

HERMIONE  Sir, spare your threats.
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity.
The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,
I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,
But know not how it went. My second joy
And first fruits of my body, from his presence
I am barred like one infectious. My third comfort,
Starred most unluckily, is from my breast,
The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth,
Haled out to murder; myself on every post
Proclaimed a strumpet; with immodest hatred
The childbed privilege denied, which longs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this place, i' th' open air, before
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
But yet hear this (mistake me not: no life,
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honor,
Which I would free), if I shall be condemned
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
'Tis rigor, and not law. Your Honors all,
I do refer me to the oracle.
Apollo be my judge.

LORD  This your request
Is altogether just. Therefore bring forth,
And in Apollo's name, his oracle.	[Officers exit.]

The Emperor of Russia was my father.
O, that he were alive and here beholding
His daughter's trial, that he did but see
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
Of pity, not revenge.

[Enter Cleomenes, Dion, with Officers.]

OFFICER, [presenting a sword]
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence have
This sealed-up oracle, by the hand delivered
Of great Apollo's priest, and that since then
You have not dared to break the holy seal
Nor read the secrets in 't.

CLEOMENES, DION  All this we swear.

LEONTES  Break up the seals and read.

OFFICER [reads]  Hermione is chaste, Polixenes blameless,
Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant,
his innocent babe truly begotten; and the King shall
live without an heir if that which is lost be not
found.

LORDS
Now blessed be the great Apollo!

HERMIONE  Praised!

LEONTES  Hast thou read truth?

Ay, my lord, even so as it is here set down.

There is no truth at all i' th' oracle.
The sessions shall proceed. This is mere falsehood.


My lord the King, the King!

LEONTES  What is the business?

O sir, I shall be hated to report it.
The Prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
Of the Queen's speed, is gone.

LEONTES  How? Gone?

SERVANT  Is dead.

Apollo's angry, and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice.
[Hermione falls.]
How now there?

This news is mortal to the Queen. Look down
And see what death is doing.

LEONTES  Take her hence.
Her heart is but o'ercharged. She will recover.
I have too much believed mine own suspicion.
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life.

[Paulina exits with Officers carrying Hermione.]

Apollo, pardon
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle.
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
For, being transported by my jealousies
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
Camillo for the minister to poison
My friend Polixenes, which had been done
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command, though I with death and with
Reward did threaten and encourage him,
Not doing it and being done. He, most humane
And filled with honor, to my kingly guest
Unclasped my practice, quit his fortunes here,
Which you knew great, and to the hazard
Of all incertainties himself commended,
No richer than his honor. How he glisters
Through my rust, and how his piety
Does my deeds make the blacker!

[Enter Paulina.]

PAULINA  Woe the while!
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
Break too!

LORD  What fit is this, good lady?

PAULINA, [to Leontes]
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels, racks, fires? What flaying? Boiling
In leads or oils? What old or newer torture
Must I receive, whose every word deserves
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,
Together working with thy jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done,
And then run mad indeed, stark mad, for all
Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betrayedst Polixenes, 'twas nothing;
That did but show thee of a fool, inconstant
And damnable ingrateful. Nor was 't much
Thou wouldst have poisoned good Camillo's honor,
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by, whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter
To be or none or little, though a devil
Would have shed water out of fire ere done 't.
Nor is 't directly laid to thee the death
Of the young prince, whose honorable thoughts,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemished his gracious dam. This is not, no,
Laid to thy answer. But the last--O lords,
When I have said, cry woe!--the Queen, the Queen,
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead, and vengeance
for 't
Not dropped down yet.

LORD  The higher powers forbid!

I say she's dead. I'll swear 't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see. If you can bring
Tincture or luster in her lip, her eye,
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
As I would do the gods.--But, O thou tyrant,
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir. Therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a barren mountain, and still winter
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
To look that way thou wert.

LEONTES  Go on, go on.
Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitt'rest.

LORD, [to Paulina]  Say no more.
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
I' th' boldness of your speech.

PAULINA  I am sorry for 't.
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Alas, I have showed too much
The rashness of a woman. He is touched
To th' noble heart.--What's gone and what's past
help
Should be past grief. Do not receive affliction
At my petition. I beseech you, rather
Let me be punished, that have minded you
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman.
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children.
I'll not remember you of my own lord,
Who is lost too. Take your patience to you,
And I'll say nothing.

LEONTES  Thou didst speak but well
When most the truth, which I receive much better
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son.
One grave shall be for both. Upon them shall
The causes of their death appear, unto
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
Shall be my recreation. So long as nature
Will bear up with this exercise, so long
I daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me
To these sorrows.

[Enter Antigonus carrying the babe, and a Mariner.]

Thou art perfect, then, our ship hath touched upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

MARINER  Ay, my lord, and fear
We have landed in ill time. The skies look grimly
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
And frown upon 's.

Their sacred wills be done. Go, get aboard.
Look to thy bark. I'll not be long before
I call upon thee.

MARINER  Make your best haste, and go not
Too far i' th' land. 'Tis like to be loud weather.
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
Of prey that keep upon 't.

ANTIGONUS  Go thou away.
I'll follow instantly.

MARINER  I am glad at heart
To be so rid o' th' business.	[He exits.]

ANTIGONUS  Come, poor babe.
I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o' th' dead
May walk again. If such thing be, thy mother
Appeared to me last night, for ne'er was dream
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another.
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
So filled and so becoming. In pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lay, thrice bowed before me,
And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
Became two spouts. The fury spent, anon
Did this break from her: "Good Antigonus,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
Places remote enough are in Bohemia.
There weep, and leave it crying. And, for the babe
Is counted lost forever, Perdita
I prithee call 't. For this ungentle business
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
Thy wife Paulina more." And so, with shrieks,
She melted into air. Affrighted much,
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys,
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
I will be squared by this. I do believe
Hermione hath suffered death, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father.--Blossom, speed thee well.
There lie, and there thy character; there these,
[He lays down the baby, a bundle, and a box.]
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And still rest thine. [Thunder.] The storm begins.
Poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow. Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds, and most accurst am I
To be by oath enjoined to this. Farewell.
The day frowns more and more. Thou 'rt like to have
A lullaby too rough. I never saw
The heavens so dim by day.
[Thunder, and sounds of hunting.]
A savage clamor!
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase.
I am gone forever!	[He exits, pursued by a bear.]

[Enter Shepherd.]

SHEPHERD  I would there were no age between ten and
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
rest, for there is nothing in the between but getting
wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing,
fighting--Hark you now. Would any but these
boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt
this weather? They have scared away two of my best
sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than
the master. If anywhere I have them, 'tis by the
seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an 't be thy will,
what have we here? Mercy on 's, a bairn! A very
pretty bairn. A boy or a child, I wonder? A pretty
one, a very pretty one. Sure some scape. Though I
am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman
in the scape. This has been some stair-work,
some trunk-work, some behind-door work. They
were warmer that got this than the poor thing is
here. I'll take it up for pity. Yet I'll tarry till my son
come. He halloed but even now.--Whoa-ho-ho!


SHEPHERD'S SON  Hilloa, loa!

SHEPHERD  What, art so near? If thou 'lt see a thing to
talk on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither.
What ail'st thou, man?

SHEPHERD'S SON  I have seen two such sights, by sea
and by land--but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is
now the sky; betwixt the firmament and it, you
cannot thrust a bodkin's point.

SHEPHERD  Why, boy, how is it?

SHEPHERD'S SON  I would you did but see how it chafes,
how it rages, how it takes up the shore. But that's
not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor
souls! Sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em.
Now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast,
and anon swallowed with yeast and froth, as you'd
thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land
service, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone,
how he cried to me for help, and said his
name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
end of the ship: to see how the sea flap-dragoned it.
But, first, how the poor souls roared and the sea
mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
the sea or weather.

SHEPHERD  Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

SHEPHERD'S SON  Now, now. I have not winked since I
saw these sights. The men are not yet cold under
water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman.
He's at it now.

SHEPHERD  Would I had been by to have helped the old

SHEPHERD'S SON  I would you had been by the ship side,
to have helped her. There your charity would have
lacked footing.

SHEPHERD  Heavy matters, heavy matters. But look
thee here, boy. Now bless thyself. Thou met'st with
things dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight
for thee. Look thee, a bearing cloth for a squire's
child. Look thee here. Take up, take up, boy. Open
't. So, let's see. It was told me I should be rich by
the fairies. This is some changeling. Open 't. What's
within, boy?

SHEPHERD'S SON, [opening the box]   You're a made old
man. If the sins of your youth are forgiven you,
you're well to live. Gold, all gold.

SHEPHERD  This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so.
Up with 't, keep it close. Home, home, the next way.
We are lucky, boy, and to be so still requires
nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go. Come, good
boy, the next way home.

SHEPHERD'S SON  Go you the next way with your
findings. I'll go see if the bear be gone from the
gentleman and how much he hath eaten. They are
never curst but when they are hungry. If there be
any of him left, I'll bury it.

SHEPHERD  That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern
by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to
th' sight of him.

SHEPHERD'S SON  Marry, will I, and you shall help to
put him i' th' ground.

SHEPHERD  'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good
deeds on 't.

[Enter Polixenes and Camillo.]

POLIXENES  I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more
importunate. 'Tis a sickness denying thee anything,
a death to grant this.

CAMILLO  It is fifteen years since I saw my country.
Though I have for the most part been aired abroad,
I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
king, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling
sorrows I might be some allay--or I o'erween to
think so--which is another spur to my departure.

POLIXENES  As thou lov'st me, Camillo, wipe not out the
rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I
have of thee thine own goodness hath made. Better
not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou,
having made me businesses which none without
thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to
execute them thyself or take away with thee the very
services thou hast done, which if I have not enough
considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country
Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
penitent, as thou call'st him, and reconciled king
my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen
and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
Say to me, when sawst thou the Prince Florizell, my
son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
being gracious, than they are in losing them when
they have approved their virtues.

CAMILLO  Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince.
What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown,
but I have missingly noted he is of late
much retired from court and is less frequent to his
princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

POLIXENES  I have considered so much, Camillo, and
with some care, so far that I have eyes under my
service which look upon his removedness, from
whom I have this intelligence: that he is seldom
from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man,
they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the
imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an
unspeakable estate.

CAMILLO  I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
daughter of most rare note. The report of her is
extended more than can be thought to begin from
such a cottage.

POLIXENES  That's likewise part of my intelligence, but,
I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not
appearing what we are, have some question with
the shepherd, from whose simplicity I think it not
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
Prithee be my present partner in this business, and
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO  I willingly obey your command.

POLIXENES  My best Camillo. We must disguise
ourselves.


[Enter three Senators at one door, Alcibiades meeting
them, with Attendants.]

FIRST SENATOR, [to the Second Senator]
My lord, you have my voice to 't. The fault's
Bloody. 'Tis necessary he should die.
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.

SECOND SENATOR  Most true. The law shall bruise 'em.

Honor, health, and compassion to the Senate!

FIRST SENATOR  Now, captain?

I am an humble suitor to your virtues,
For pity is the virtue of the law,
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood
Hath stepped into the law, which is past depth
To those that without heed do plunge into 't.
He is a man--setting his fate aside--
Of comely virtues.
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
An honor in him which buys out his fault--
But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
Seeing his reputation touched to death,
He did oppose his foe;
And with such sober and unnoted passion
He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
As if he had but proved an argument.

You undergo too strict a paradox,
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair.
Your words have took such pains as if they labored
To bring manslaughter into form and set quarreling
Upon the head of valor--which indeed
Is valor misbegot, and came into the world
When sects and factions were newly born.
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
The worst that man can breathe
And make his wrongs his outsides,
To wear them like his raiment, carelessly,
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart
To bring it into danger.
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!

My lord--

FIRST SENATOR  You cannot make gross sins look clear.
To revenge is no valor, but to bear.

My lords, then, under favor, pardon me
If I speak like a captain.
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle
And not endure all threats? Sleep upon 't,
And let the foes quietly cut their throats
Without repugnancy? If there be
Such valor in the bearing, what make we
Abroad? Why, then, women are more valiant
That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,
As you are great, be pitifully good.
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust,
But in defense, by mercy, 'tis most just.
To be in anger is impiety,
But who is man that is not angry?
Weigh but the crime with this.

SECOND SENATOR  You breathe in vain.

ALCIBIADES  In vain? His service done
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
Were a sufficient briber for his life.

FIRST SENATOR  What's that?

Why, I say, my lords, has done fair service
And slain in fight many of your enemies.
How full of valor did he bear himself
In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!

He has made too much plenty with 'em.
He's a sworn rioter. He has a sin
That often drowns him and takes his valor prisoner.
If there were no foes, that were enough
To overcome him. In that beastly fury,
He has been known to commit outrages
And cherish factions. 'Tis inferred to us
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.

He dies.

ALCIBIADES  Hard fate! He might have died in war.
My lords, if not for any parts in him--
Though his right arm might purchase his own time
And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,
Take my deserts to his and join 'em both.
And, for I know your reverend ages love
Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
My honor, to you, upon his good returns.
If by this crime he owes the law his life,
Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore,
For law is strict, and war is nothing more.

We are for law. He dies. Urge it no more,
On height of our displeasure. Friend or brother,
He forfeits his own blood that spills another.

ALCIBIADES  Must it be so? It must not be.
My lords, I do beseech you, know me.

SECOND SENATOR  How?

ALCIBIADES  Call me to your remembrances.

THIRD SENATOR  What?

I cannot think but your age has forgot me.
It could not else be I should prove so base
To sue and be denied such common grace.
My wounds ache at you.

FIRST SENATOR  Do you dare our anger?
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:
We banish thee forever.

ALCIBIADES  Banish me?
Banish your dotage, banish usury,
That makes the Senate ugly!

If after two days' shine Athens contain thee,
Attend our weightier judgment.
And, not to swell our spirit,
He shall be executed presently.	[Senators exit.]

Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live
Only in bone, that none may look on you!--
I'm worse than mad. I have kept back their foes
While they have told their money and let out
Their coin upon large interest, I myself
Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate
Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment.
It comes not ill. I hate not to be banished.
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up
My discontented troops and lay for hearts.
'Tis honor with most lands to be at odds.
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.

[Enter Steward Flavius with two or three Servants.]

Hear you, Master Steward, where's our master?
Are we undone, cast off, nothing remaining?

Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,
I am as poor as you.

FIRST SERVANT  Such a house broke?
So noble a master fall'n, all gone, and not
One friend to take his fortune by the arm
And go along with him?

SECOND SERVANT  As we do turn our backs
From our companion thrown into his grave,
So his familiars to his buried fortunes
Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,
Like empty purses picked; and his poor self,
A dedicated beggar to the air,
With his disease of all-shunned poverty,
Walks, like contempt, alone.

[Enter other Servants.]

More of our fellows.

All broken implements of a ruined house.

Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery.
That see I by our faces. We are fellows still,
Serving alike in sorrow. Leaked is our bark,
And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
Hearing the surges threat. We must all part
Into this sea of air.

FLAVIUS  Good fellows all,
The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake
Let's yet be fellows. Let's shake our heads and say,
As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,
"We have seen better days." [(He offers them
money.)] Let each take some.
Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more.
Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
[The Servants embrace and part several ways.]
O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
Since riches point to misery and contempt?
Who would be so mocked with glory, or to live
But in a dream of friendship,
To have his pomp and all what state compounds
But only painted, like his varnished friends?
Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
Undone by goodness! Strange unusual blood
When man's worst sin is he does too much good!
Who then dares to be half so kind again?
For bounty, that makes gods, do still mar men.
My dearest lord, blest to be most accursed,
Rich only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!
He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
Of monstrous friends,
Nor has he with him to supply his life,
Or that which can command it.
I'll follow and inquire him out.
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will.
Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.

[Trumpets sound. Enter Alcibiades with his Powers
before Athens.]

Sound to this coward and lascivious town
Our terrible approach.	[Sounds a parley.]

[The Senators appear upon the walls.]

Till now you have gone on and filled the time
With all licentious measure, making your wills
The scope of justice. Till now myself and such
As slept within the shadow of your power
Have wandered with our traversed arms and breathed
Our sufferance vainly. Now the time is flush,
When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
Cries of itself "No more!" Now breathless wrong
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
And pursy insolence shall break his wind
With fear and horrid flight.

FIRST SENATOR  Noble and young,
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
We sent to thee to give thy rages balm,
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
Above their quantity.

SECOND SENATOR  So did we woo
Transformed Timon to our city's love
By humble message and by promised means.
We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
The common stroke of war.

FIRST SENATOR  These walls of ours
Were not erected by their hands from whom
You have received your grief, nor are they such
That these great towers, trophies, and schools
should fall
For private faults in them.

SECOND SENATOR  Nor are they living
Who were the motives that you first went out.
Shame, that they wanted cunning, in excess
Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
Into our city with thy banners spread.
By decimation and a tithed death,
If thy revenges hunger for that food
Which nature loathes, take thou the destined tenth
And, by the hazard of the spotted die,
Let die the spotted.

FIRST SENATOR  All have not offended.
For those that were, it is not square to take,
On those that are, revenge. Crimes, like lands,
Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
Bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage.
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
With those that have offended. Like a shepherd
Approach the fold and cull th' infected forth,
But kill not all together.

SECOND SENATOR  What thou wilt,
Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
Than hew to 't with thy sword.

FIRST SENATOR  Set but thy foot
Against our rampired gates and they shall ope,
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
To say thou 'lt enter friendly.

SECOND SENATOR  Throw thy glove,
Or any token of thine honor else,
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
And not as our confusion, all thy powers
Shall make their harbor in our town till we
Have sealed thy full desire.

ALCIBIADES  Then there's my glove.
Descend and open your uncharged ports.
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
Fall, and no more. And to atone your fears
With my more noble meaning, not a man
Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream
Of regular justice in your city's bounds
But shall be remedied to your public laws
At heaviest answer.

BOTH  'Tis most nobly spoken.

ALCIBIADES  Descend and keep your words.
[The Senators descend.]

[Enter a Soldier, with the wax tablet.]

My noble general, Timon is dead,
Entombed upon the very hem o' th' sea,
And on his gravestone this insculpture, which
With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
Interprets for my poor ignorance.

ALCIBIADES [reads the epitaph.]
Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft.
Seek not my name. A plague consume you, wicked
caitiffs left!
Here lie I, Timon, who, alive, all living men did hate.
Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here
thy gait.
These well express in thee thy latter spirits.
Though thou abhorred'st in us our human griefs,
Scorned'st our brains' flow and those our droplets
which
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
Is noble Timon, of whose memory
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
And I will use the olive with my sword,
Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make
Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
Let our drums strike.
[Drums. They exit.]

[Enter the Judges and Senators with Titus' two sons
(Quintus and Martius) bound, passing on the stage to
the place of execution, and Titus going before, pleading.]

Hear me, grave fathers; noble tribunes, stay.
For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed,
For all the frosty nights that I have watched,
And for these bitter tears which now you see,
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,
Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
Whose souls is not corrupted as 'tis thought.
For two-and-twenty sons I never wept
Because they died in honor's lofty bed.
[Andronicus lieth down, and the Judges pass by him.]
[They exit with the prisoners as Titus continues speaking.]
For these, tribunes, in the dust I write
My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite.
My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
O Earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
That shall distil from these two ancient ruins
Than youthful April shall with all his showers.
In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
And keep eternal springtime on thy face,
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.

[Enter Lucius with his weapon drawn.]

O reverend tribunes, O gentle aged men,
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,
And let me say, that never wept before,
My tears are now prevailing orators.

O noble father, you lament in vain.
The Tribunes hear you not; no man is by,
And you recount your sorrows to a stone.

Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.--
Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you--

My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.

Why, 'tis no matter, man. If they did hear,
They would not mark me; if they did mark,
They would not pity me. Yet plead I must,
And bootless unto them.
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,
Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes,
For that they will not intercept my tale.
When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me,
And were they but attired in grave weeds,
Rome could afford no tribunes like to these.
A stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than
A stone is silent and offendeth not,
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?

To rescue my two brothers from their death,
For which attempt the Judges have pronounced
My everlasting doom of banishment.

O happy man, they have befriended thee!
Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
But me and mine. How happy art thou then
From these devourers to be banished.
But who comes with our brother Marcus here?

[Enter Marcus with Lavinia.]

Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,
Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break.
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.

Will it consume me? Let me see it, then.

This was thy daughter.

TITUS  Why, Marcus, so she is.

LUCIUS  Ay me, this object kills me!

Faint-hearted boy, arise and look upon her.--
Speak, Lavinia. What accursed hand
Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
What fool hath added water to the sea
Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
My grief was at the height before thou cam'st,
And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.--
Give me a sword. I'll chop off my hands too,
For they have fought for Rome and all in vain;
And they have nursed this woe in feeding life;
In bootless prayer have they been held up,
And they have served me to effectless use.
Now all the service I require of them
Is that the one will help to cut the other.--
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,
For hands to do Rome service is but vain.

Speak, gentle sister. Who hath martyred thee?

O, that delightful engine of her thoughts,
That blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence,
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage
Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung
Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear.

O, say thou for her who hath done this deed!

O, thus I found her straying in the park,
Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
That hath received some unrecuring wound.

It was my dear, and he that wounded her
Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead.
For now I stand as one upon a rock,
Environed with a wilderness of sea,
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
Expecting ever when some envious surge
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
Here stands my other son a banished man,
And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight
It would have madded me. What shall I do,
Now I behold thy lively body so?
Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,
Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee.
Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
Thy brothers are condemned, and dead by this.--
Look, Marcus!--Ah, son Lucius, look on her!
When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
Stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew
Upon a gathered lily almost withered.

Perchance she weeps because they killed her husband,
Perchance because she knows them innocent.

If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.--
No, no, they would not do so foul a deed.
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.--
Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.
Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius
And thou and I sit round about some fountain,
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks,
How they are stained like meadows yet not dry
With miry slime left on them by a flood?
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
And made a brine pit with our bitter tears?
Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?
Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
What shall we do? Let us that have our tongues
Plot some device of further misery
To make us wondered at in time to come.

Sweet father, cease your tears, for at your grief
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.

Patience, dear niece.--Good Titus, dry thine eyes.

Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
For thou, poor man, hast drowned it with thine own.

Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.

Mark, Marcus, mark. I understand her signs.
Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
That to her brother which I said to thee.
His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
O, what a sympathy of woe is this,
As far from help as limbo is from bliss.

[Enter Aaron the Moor alone.]

Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
Sends thee this word, that if thou love thy sons,
Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
Or any one of you, chop off your hand
And send it to the King; he for the same
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,
And that shall be the ransom for their fault.

O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
With all my heart I'll send the Emperor my hand.
Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?

Stay, father, for that noble hand of thine,
That hath thrown down so many enemies,
Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn.
My youth can better spare my blood than you,
And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.

Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
And reared aloft the bloody battleax,
Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
O, none of both but are of high desert.
My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
To ransom my two nephews from their death.
Then have I kept it to a worthy end.

Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
For fear they die before their pardon come.

My hand shall go.

LUCIUS  By heaven, it shall not go!

Sirs, strive no more. Such withered herbs as these
Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.

Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
Let me redeem my brothers both from death.

And for our father's sake and mother's care,
Now let me show a brother's love to thee.

Agree between you. I will spare my hand.

LUCIUS  Then I'll go fetch an ax.

MARCUS  But I will use the ax.	[Lucius and Marcus exit.]

Come hither, Aaron. I'll deceive them both.
Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.

If that be called deceit, I will be honest
And never whilst I live deceive men so.
But I'll deceive you in another sort,
And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.
[He cuts off Titus' hand.]

[Enter Lucius and Marcus again.]

Now stay your strife. What shall be is dispatched.--
Good Aaron, give his Majesty my hand.
Tell him it was a hand that warded him
From thousand dangers. Bid him bury it.
More hath it merited; that let it have.
As for my sons, say I account of them
As jewels purchased at an easy price,
And yet dear, too, because I bought mine own.

I go, Andronicus, and for thy hand
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
[Aside.] Their heads, I mean. O, how this villainy
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
Let fools do good and fair men call for grace;
Aaron will have his soul black like his face.

O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth.	[He kneels.]
If any power pities wretched tears,
To that I call. [(Lavinia kneels.)] What, wouldst thou
kneel with me?
Do, then, dear heart, for heaven shall hear our
prayers,
Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim
And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.

O brother, speak with possibility,
And do not break into these deep extremes.

Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
Then be my passions bottomless with them.

But yet let reason govern thy lament.

If there were reason for these miseries,
Then into limits could I bind my woes.
When heaven doth weep, doth not the Earth o'erflow?
If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swoll'n face?
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
I am the sea. Hark how her sighs doth flow!
She is the weeping welkin, I the Earth.
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
Then must my Earth with her continual tears
Become a deluge, overflowed and drowned,
Forwhy my bowels cannot hide her woes
But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
Then give me leave, for losers will have leave
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.

[Enter a Messenger with two heads and a hand.]

Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
For that good hand thou sent'st the Emperor.
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons,
And here's thy hand in scorn to thee sent back.
Thy grief their sports, thy resolution mocked,
That woe is me to think upon thy woes
More than remembrance of my father's death.

Now let hot Etna cool in Sicily,
And be my heart an everburning hell!
These miseries are more than may be borne.
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,
But sorrow flouted at is double death.

Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound
And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
That ever death should let life bear his name,
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe.
[Lavinia kisses Titus.]

Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
As frozen water to a starved snake.

When will this fearful slumber have an end?

Now farewell, flatt'ry; die, Andronicus.
Thou dost not slumber. See thy two sons' heads,
Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here,
Thy other banished son with this dear sight
Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,
Even like a stony image cold and numb.
Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs.
Rent off thy silver hair, thy other hand,
Gnawing with thy teeth, and be this dismal sight
The closing up of our most wretched eyes.
Now is a time to storm. Why art thou still?

TITUS  Ha, ha, ha!

Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.
[Titus and Lavinia rise.]

Why, I have not another tear to shed.
Besides, this sorrow is an enemy
And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes
And make them blind with tributary tears.
Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
For these two heads do seem to speak to me
And threat me I shall never come to bliss
Till all these mischiefs be returned again
Even in their throats that hath committed them.
Come, let me see what task I have to do.
You heavy people, circle me about
That I may turn me to each one of you
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
And in this hand the other will I bear.--
And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employed in these arms.
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy
teeth.--
As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight.
Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
Hie to the Goths and raise an army there.
And if you love me, as I think you do,
Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
[All but Lucius exit.]

Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,
The woefull'st man that ever lived in Rome.
Farewell, proud Rome, till Lucius come again.
He loves his pledges dearer than his life.
Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister.
O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs
And make proud Saturnine and his empress
Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen.
Now will I to the Goths and raise a power
To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.

[Enter Lucius, Marcus, and the Goths, with Aaron,
Guards, and an Attendant carrying the baby.]

Uncle Marcus, since 'tis my father's mind
That I repair to Rome, I am content.

And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.

Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil.
Let him receive no sust'nance. Fetter him
Till he be brought unto the Empress' face
For testimony of her foul proceedings.
And see the ambush of our friends be strong.
I fear the Emperor means no good to us.

Some devil whisper curses in my ear
And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth
The venomous malice of my swelling heart.

Away, inhuman dog, unhallowed slave!--
Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
[Sound trumpets.]
The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand.
[Guards and Aaron exit.]

with Aemilius, Tribunes, Attendants, and others.]

What, hath the firmament more suns than one?

What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?

Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle.
These quarrels must be quietly debated.
The feast is ready which the careful Titus
Hath ordained to an honorable end,
For peace, for love, for league and good to Rome.
Please you therefore draw nigh and take your places.

SATURNINUS  Marcus, we will.

[Trumpets sounding, enter Titus like a cook, placing the
dishes, with young Lucius and others, and Lavinia
with a veil over her face.]

Welcome, my lord;--welcome, dread queen;--
Welcome, you warlike Goths;--welcome, Lucius;--
And welcome, all. Although the cheer be poor,
'Twill fill your stomachs. Please you eat of it.
[They begin to eat.]

Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?

Because I would be sure to have all well
To entertain your Highness and your empress.

We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.

An if your Highness knew my heart, you were.--
My lord the Emperor, resolve me this:
Was it well done of rash Virginius
To slay his daughter with his own right hand
Because she was enforced, stained, and deflowered?

SATURNINUS  It was, Andronicus.

TITUS  Your reason, mighty lord?

Because the girl should not survive her shame,
And by her presence still renew his sorrows.

A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant
For me, most wretched, to perform the like.
Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee,
And with thy shame thy father's sorrow die.
[He kills Lavinia.]

What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?

Killed her for whom my tears have made me blind.
I am as woeful as Virginius was,
And have a thousand times more cause than he
To do this outrage, and it now is done.

What, was she ravished? Tell who did the deed.

Will 't please you eat?--Will 't please your Highness
feed?

Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?

Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.
They ravished her and cut away her tongue,
And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.

Go fetch them hither to us presently.

Why, there they are, both baked in this pie,
Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
'Tis true, 'tis true! Witness my knife's sharp point.
[He stabs the Empress.]

Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed.
[He kills Titus.]

Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
[He kills Saturninus.]
There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed.
[A great tumult. Lucius, Marcus, and
others go aloft to the upper stage.]

You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
By uproars severed as a flight of fowl
Scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
O, let me teach you how to knit again
This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,
These broken limbs again into one body,
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
Do shameful execution on herself.
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
Grave witnesses of true experience,
Cannot induce you to attend my words,
[He turns to Lucius.]
Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
To lovesick Dido's sad-attending ear
The story of that baleful burning night
When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy.
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitched our ears,
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.--
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel,
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
But floods of tears will drown my oratory
And break my utterance even in the time
When it should move you to attend me most
And force you to commiseration.
Here's Rome's young captain. Let him tell the tale,
While I stand by and weep to hear him speak.

Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you
That Chiron and the damned Demetrius
Were they that murdered our emperor's brother,
And they it were that ravished our sister.
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,
Our father's tears despised, and basely cozened
Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out
And sent her enemies unto the grave;
Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
The gates shut on me, and turned weeping out
To beg relief among Rome's enemies,
Who drowned their enmity in my true tears
And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
I am the turned-forth, be it known to you,
That have preserved her welfare in my blood
And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body.
Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;
My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
That my report is just and full of truth.
But soft, methinks I do digress too much,
Citing my worthless praise. O, pardon me,
For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.

Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child.
Of this was Tamora delivered,
The issue of an irreligious Moor,
Chief architect and plotter of these woes.
The villain is alive in Titus' house,
And as he is to witness, this is true.
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
These wrongs unspeakable, past patience,
Or more than any living man could bear.
Now have you heard the truth. What say you,
Romans?
Have we done aught amiss? Show us wherein,
And from the place where you behold us pleading,
The poor remainder of Andronici
Will, hand in hand, all headlong hurl ourselves,
And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls,
And make a mutual closure of our house.
Speak, Romans, speak, and if you say we shall,
Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.

Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
Lucius our emperor, for well I know
The common voice do cry it shall be so.

ROMANS
Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!

MARCUS, [to Attendants]
Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,
And hither hale that misbelieving Moor
To be adjudged some direful slaught'ring death
As punishment for his most wicked life.
[Attendants exit. Lucius and Marcus
come down from the upper stage.]

ROMANS
Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!

Thanks, gentle Romans. May I govern so
To heal Rome's harms and wipe away her woe!
But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
For nature puts me to a heavy task.
Stand all aloof, but, uncle, draw you near
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
[He kisses Titus.]
O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
These sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstained face,
The last true duties of thy noble son.

Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.
[He kisses Titus.]
O, were the sum of these that I should pay
Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them.

LUCIUS, [to Young Lucius]
Come hither, boy. Come, come, and learn of us
To melt in showers. Thy grandsire loved thee well.
Many a time he danced thee on his knee,
Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;
Many a story hath he told to thee,
And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind
And talk of them when he was dead and gone.

How many thousand times hath these poor lips,
When they were living, warmed themselves on thine!
O, now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss.
Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave.
Do them that kindness, and take leave of them.

O grandsire, grandsire, ev'n with all my heart
Would I were dead so you did live again!
[He kisses Titus.]
O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping.
My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.

[Enter Aaron with Guards.]

ROMAN
You sad Andronici, have done with woes.
Give sentence on this execrable wretch
That hath been breeder of these dire events.

Set him breast-deep in earth and famish him.
There let him stand and rave and cry for food.
If anyone relieves or pities him,
For the offense he dies. This is our doom.
Some stay to see him fastened in the earth.

Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?
I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
I should repent the evils I have done.
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
Would I perform, if I might have my will.
If one good deed in all my life I did,
I do repent it from my very soul.
[Aaron is led off by Guards.]

Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,
And give him burial in his fathers' grave.
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
Be closed in our household's monument.
As for that ravenous tiger, Tamora,
No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed;
No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.
Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,
And being dead, let birds on her take pity.

[Music sounds within. Enter Pandarus and Paris's
Servingman.]

PANDARUS  Friend, you, pray you, a word. Do you not
follow the young Lord Paris?

MAN  Ay, sir, when he goes before me.

PANDARUS  You depend upon him, I mean.

MAN  Sir, I do depend upon the Lord.

PANDARUS  You depend upon a notable gentleman. I
must needs praise him.

MAN  The Lord be praised!

PANDARUS  You know me, do you not?

MAN  Faith, sir, superficially.

PANDARUS  Friend, know me better. I am the Lord
Pandarus.

MAN  I hope I shall know your Honor better.

PANDARUS  I do desire it.

MAN  You are in the state of grace?

PANDARUS  Grace? Not so, friend. "Honor" and "Lordship"
are my titles. What music is this?

MAN  I do but partly know, sir. It is music in parts.

PANDARUS  Know you the musicians?

MAN  Wholly, sir.

PANDARUS  Who play they to?

MAN  To the hearers, sir.

PANDARUS  At whose pleasure, friend?

MAN  At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.

PANDARUS  Command, I mean, friend.

MAN  Who shall I command, sir?

PANDARUS  Friend, we understand not one another. I
am too courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose
request do these men play?

MAN  That's to 't indeed, sir. Marry, sir, at the request of
Paris my lord, who is there in person; with him the
mortal Venus, the heart blood of beauty, love's visible
soul.

PANDARUS  Who, my cousin Cressida?

MAN  No, sir, Helen. Could not you find out that by her
attributes?

PANDARUS  It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not
seen the Lady Cressid. I come to speak with Paris
from the Prince Troilus. I will make a complimental
assault upon him, for my business seethes.

MAN  Sodden business! There's a stewed phrase indeed.

[Enter Paris and Helen with Attendants.]

PANDARUS  Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair
company! Fair desires in all fair measure fairly
guide them!--Especially to you, fair queen, fair
thoughts be your fair pillow!

HELEN  Dear lord, you are full of fair words.

PANDARUS  You speak your fair pleasure, sweet
queen.--Fair prince, here is good broken music.

PARIS  You have broke it, cousin, and, by my life, you
shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out
with a piece of your performance.

HELEN  He is full of harmony.

PANDARUS  Truly, lady, no.

HELEN  O, sir--

PANDARUS  Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.

PARIS  Well said, my lord; well, you say so in fits.

PANDARUS  I have business to my lord, dear queen.--
My lord, will you vouchsafe me a word?

HELEN  Nay, this shall not hedge us out. We'll hear you
sing, certainly.

PANDARUS  Well, sweet queen, you are pleasant with
me.--But, marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and
most esteemed friend, your brother Troilus--

HELEN  My Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord--

PANDARUS  Go to, sweet queen, go to--commends himself
most affectionately to you--

HELEN  You shall not bob us out of our melody. If you
do, our melancholy upon your head!

PANDARUS  Sweet queen, sweet queen, that's a sweet
queen, i' faith--

HELEN  And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.

PANDARUS  Nay, that shall not serve your turn, that
shall it not, in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such
words, no, no.--And, my lord, he desires you that
if the King call for him at supper, you will make his
excuse.

HELEN  My Lord Pandarus--

PANDARUS  What says my sweet queen, my very, very
sweet queen?

PARIS  What exploit's in hand? Where sups he tonight?

HELEN  Nay, but, my lord--

PANDARUS  What says my sweet queen? My cousin will
fall out with you.

HELEN, [to Paris]  You must not know where he sups.

PARIS  I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.

PANDARUS  No, no, no such matter; you are wide.
Come, your disposer is sick.

PARIS  Well, I'll make 's excuse.

PANDARUS  Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?
No, your poor disposer's sick.

PARIS  I spy.

PANDARUS  You spy? What do you spy?--Come, give me
an instrument. [An Attendant gives him an instrument.]
Now, sweet queen.

HELEN  Why, this is kindly done.

PANDARUS  My niece is horribly in love with a thing you
have, sweet queen.

HELEN  She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my Lord
Paris.

PANDARUS  He? No, she'll none of him. They two are
twain.

HELEN  Falling in after falling out may make them

PANDARUS  Come, come, I'll hear no more of this. I'll
sing you a song now.

HELEN  Ay, ay, prithee. Now, by my troth, sweet lord,
thou hast a fine forehead.

PANDARUS  Ay, you may, you may.

HELEN  Let thy song be love. "This love will undo us all."
O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!

PANDARUS  Love? Ay, that it shall, i' faith.

PARIS  Ay, good now, "Love, love, nothing but love."

PANDARUS  In good troth, it begins so.
	Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!
	   For, O, love's bow
	   Shoots buck and doe.
	   The shaft confounds
	   Not that it wounds
	But tickles still the sore.

	These lovers cry "O ho!" they die,
	   Yet that which seems the wound to kill
	Doth turn "O ho!" to "Ha ha he!"
	   So dying love lives still.
	"O ho!" awhile, but "Ha ha ha!"
	"O ho!"groans out for "ha ha ha!"--Hey ho!

HELEN  In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.

PARIS  He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds
hot blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and
hot thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.

PANDARUS  Is this the generation of love? Hot blood,
hot thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers.
Is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's
afield today?

PARIS  Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the
gallantry of Troy. I would fain have armed today,
but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my
brother Troilus went not?

HELEN  He hangs the lip at something.--You know all,
Lord Pandarus.

PANDARUS  Not I, honey sweet queen. I long to hear how
they sped today.--You'll remember your brother's
excuse?

PARIS  To a hair.

PANDARUS  Farewell, sweet queen.

HELEN  Commend me to your niece.

PANDARUS  I will, sweet queen.	[He exits.]
[Sound a retreat.]

They're come from the field. Let us to Priam's hall
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
To help unarm our Hector. His stubborn buckles,
With these your white enchanting fingers touched,
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
Or force of Greekish sinews. You shall do more
Than all the island kings: disarm great Hector.

'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris.
Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
Yea, overshines ourself.

PARIS  Sweet, above thought I love thee.


TROILUS  Are there such? Such are not we. Praise us as
we are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall
go bare till merit crown it. No perfection in reversion
shall have a praise in present. We will not
name desert before his birth, and, being born, his
addition shall be humble. Few words to fair faith.
Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can
say worst shall be a mock for his truth, and what
truth can speak truest not truer than Troilus.



PANDARUS  What, blushing still? Have you not done
talking yet?

CRESSIDA  Well, uncle, what folly I commit I dedicate

PANDARUS  I thank you for that. If my lord get a boy of
you, you'll give him me. Be true to my lord. If he
flinch, chide me for it.

TROILUS, [to Cressida]  You know now your hostages:
your uncle's word and my firm faith.

PANDARUS  Nay, I'll give my word for her too. Our kindred,
though they be long ere they be wooed, they
are constant being won. They are burrs, I can tell
you; they'll stick where they are thrown.

Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart.
Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
For many weary months.

Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?

Hard to seem won; but I was won, my lord,
With the first glance that ever--pardon me;
If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
I love you now, but till now not so much
But I might master it. In faith, I lie;
My thoughts were like unbridled children grown
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
Why have I blabbed? Who shall be true to us
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
But though I loved you well, I wooed you not;
And yet, good faith, I wished myself a man;
Or that we women had men's privilege
Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
For in this rapture I shall surely speak
The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
My very soul of counsel! Stop my mouth.

And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.

PANDARUS  Pretty, i' faith!

My lord, I do beseech you pardon me.
'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.
I am ashamed. O heavens, what have I done!
For this time will I take my leave, my lord.

TROILUS  Your leave, sweet Cressid?

PANDARUS  Leave? An you take leave till tomorrow
morning--

CRESSIDA  Pray you, content you.

TROILUS  What offends you, lady?

CRESSIDA  Sir, mine own company.

TROILUS  You cannot shun yourself.

CRESSIDA  Let me go and try.
I have a kind of self resides with you,
But an unkind self that itself will leave
To be another's fool. I would be gone.
Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.

Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.

Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love
And fell so roundly to a large confession
To angle for your thoughts. But you are wise,
Or else you love not; for to be wise and love
Exceeds man's might. That dwells with gods above.

O, that I thought it could be in a woman--
As, if it can, I will presume in you--
To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love,
To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me
That my integrity and truth to you
Might be affronted with the match and weight
Of such a winnowed purity in love;
How were I then uplifted! But, alas,
I am as true as truth's simplicity
And simpler than the infancy of truth.

In that I'll war with you.

TROILUS  O virtuous fight,
When right with right wars who shall be most right!
True swains in love shall in the world to come
Approve their truth by Troilus. When their rhymes,
Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
Wants similes, truth tired with iteration--
"As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
As iron to adamant, as Earth to th' center"--
Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
As truth's authentic author to be cited,
"As true as Troilus" shall crown up the verse
And sanctify the numbers.

CRESSIDA  Prophet may you be!
If I be false or swerve a hair from truth,
When time is old and hath forgot itself,
When water drops have worn the stones of Troy
And blind oblivion swallowed cities up,
And mighty states characterless are grated
To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
From false to false, among false maids in love,
Upbraid my falsehood! When they've said "as false
As air, as water, wind or sandy earth,
As fox to lamb, or wolf to heifer's calf,
Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,"
Yea, let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
"As false as Cressid."

PANDARUS  Go to, a bargain made. Seal it, seal it. I'll be
the witness. Here I hold your hand, here my
cousin's. If ever you prove false one to another, since
I have taken such pains to bring you together, let
all pitiful goers-between be called to the world's
end after my name: call them all panders. Let all
constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,
and all brokers-between panders. Say "Amen."

TROILUS  Amen.

CRESSIDA  Amen.

PANDARUS  Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber
with a bed, which bed, because it shall not
speak of your pretty encounters, press it to death.
Away.	[Troilus and Cressida exit.]
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
Bed, chamber, pander to provide this gear.

[Alarum. Excursions. Enter Thersites.]

THERSITES  Now they are clapper-clawing one another.
I'll go look on. That dissembling abominable varlet,
Diomed, has got that same scurvy doting foolish
young knave's sleeve of Troy there in his helm.
I would fain see them meet, that that same young
Trojan ass that loves the whore there might send
that Greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve
back to the dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless
errand. O' th' t'other side, the policy of those
crafty swearing rascals--that stale old mouse-eaten
dry cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox,
Ulysses--is proved not worth a blackberry. They
set me up, in policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against
that dog of as bad a kind, Achilles. And now is the
cur Ajax prouder than the cur Achilles, and will
not arm today, whereupon the Grecians begin to
proclaim barbarism, and policy grows into an ill
opinion.

[Enter Diomedes, and Troilus pursuing him.]

Soft! Here comes sleeve and t' other.
[Thersites moves aside.]

TROILUS, [to Diomedes]
Fly not, for shouldst thou take the river Styx
I would swim after.

DIOMEDES  Thou dost miscall retire.
I do not fly, but advantageous care
Withdrew me from the odds of multitude.
Have at thee!	[They fight.]

THERSITES  Hold thy whore, Grecian! Now for thy
whore, Trojan! Now the sleeve, now the sleeve!
[Diomedes and Troilus exit fighting.]

[Enter Hector.]

What art thou, Greek? Art thou for Hector's match?
Art thou of blood and honor?

THERSITES  No, no, I am a rascal, a scurvy railing
knave, a very filthy rogue.

HECTOR  I do believe thee. Live.	[He exits.]

THERSITES  God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me!
But a plague break thy neck for frighting me!
What's become of the wenching rogues? I think
they have swallowed one another. I would laugh at
that miracle--yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself. I'll
seek them.


Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!


DIOMEDES  Troilus, I say! Where's Troilus?

AJAX  What wouldst thou?

DIOMEDES  I would correct him.

Were I the General, thou shouldst have my office
Ere that correction.--Troilus, I say! What, Troilus!


O traitor Diomed! Turn thy false face, thou traitor,
And pay the life thou owest me for my horse!

DIOMEDES  Ha! Art thou there?

I'll fight with him alone. Stand, Diomed.

He is my prize. I will not look upon.

Come, both you cogging Greeks. Have at you both!

[Enter Hector.]

[Troilus exits, fighting Diomedes and Ajax.]

Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!


Now do I see thee. Ha! Have at thee, Hector!
[They fight.]

HECTOR  Pause if thou wilt.

I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan.
Be happy that my arms are out of use.
My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
But thou anon shalt hear of me again;
Till when, go seek thy fortune.	[He exits.]

HECTOR  Fare thee well.
I would have been much more a fresher man
Had I expected thee.


How now, my brother?

Ajax hath ta'en Aeneas. Shall it be?
No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
He shall not carry him. I'll be ta'en too
Or bring him off. Fate, hear me what I say!
I reck not though I end my life today.

[Enter one in Greek armor.]

Stand, stand, thou Greek! Thou art a goodly mark.
No? Wilt thou not? I like thy armor well.
I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
But I'll be master of it.	[The Greek exits.]
Wilt thou not, beast, abide?
Why then, fly on. I'll hunt thee for thy hide.

[Enter Achilles, with Myrmidons.]

Come here about me, you my Myrmidons.
Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel.
Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath,
And, when I have the bloody Hector found,
Empale him with your weapons round about.
In fellest manner execute your arms.
Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye.
It is decreed Hector the great must die.

[Enter Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other Lords,
with Musicians playing.]

If music be the food of love, play on.
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
The appetite may sicken and so die.
That strain again! It had a dying fall.
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound
That breathes upon a bank of violets,
Stealing and giving odor. Enough; no more.
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,
That, notwithstanding thy capacity
Receiveth as the sea, naught enters there,
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
But falls into abatement and low price
Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy
That it alone is high fantastical.

CURIO
Will you go hunt, my lord?

ORSINO  What, Curio?

CURIO  The hart.

Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
Methought she purged the air of pestilence.
That instant was I turned into a hart,
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
E'er since pursue me.


How now, what news from her?

So please my lord, I might not be admitted,
But from her handmaid do return this answer:
The element itself, till seven years' heat,
Shall not behold her face at ample view,
But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,
And water once a day her chamber round
With eye-offending brine--all this to season
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
And lasting in her sad remembrance.

O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
How will she love when the rich golden shaft
Hath killed the flock of all affections else
That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and filled
Her sweet perfections with one self king!
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers!
Love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.


MARIA  Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I
will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter
in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy
absence.

FOOL  Let her hang me. He that is well hanged in this
world needs to fear no colors.

MARIA  Make that good.

FOOL  He shall see none to fear.

MARIA  A good Lenten answer. I can tell thee where
that saying was born, of "I fear no colors."

FOOL  Where, good Mistress Mary?

MARIA  In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in
your foolery.

FOOL  Well, God give them wisdom that have it, and
those that are Fools, let them use their talents.

MARIA  Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent.
Or to be turned away, is not that as good as a
hanging to you?

FOOL  Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage,
and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.

MARIA  You are resolute, then?

FOOL  Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.

MARIA  That if one break, the other will hold, or if both
break, your gaskins fall.

FOOL  Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way. If Sir
Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.

MARIA  Peace, you rogue. No more o' that. Here comes
my lady. Make your excuse wisely, you were best.

[Enter Lady Olivia with Malvolio and Attendants.]

FOOL, [aside]  Wit, an 't be thy will, put me into good
fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very
oft prove fools, and I that am sure I lack thee may
pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus?
"Better a witty Fool than a foolish wit."--God bless
thee, lady!

OLIVIA  Take the Fool away.

FOOL  Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the Lady.

OLIVIA  Go to, you're a dry Fool. I'll no more of you.
Besides, you grow dishonest.

FOOL  Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
will amend. For give the dry Fool drink, then is
the Fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend
himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he
cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that's
mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is
but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but
patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism
will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is
no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty's a flower.
The Lady bade take away the Fool. Therefore, I say
again, take her away.

OLIVIA  Sir, I bade them take away you.

FOOL  Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus
non facit monachum. That's as much to say as, I
wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give
me leave to prove you a fool.

OLIVIA  Can you do it?

FOOL  Dexteriously, good madonna.

OLIVIA  Make your proof.

FOOL  I must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my
mouse of virtue, answer me.

OLIVIA  Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide
your proof.

FOOL  Good madonna, why mourn'st thou?

OLIVIA  Good Fool, for my brother's death.

FOOL  I think his soul is in hell, madonna.

OLIVIA  I know his soul is in heaven, Fool.

FOOL  The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your
brother's soul, being in heaven. Take away the fool,

OLIVIA  What think you of this Fool, Malvolio? Doth he
not mend?

MALVOLIO  Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death
shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth
ever make the better Fool.

FOOL  God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn
that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for
twopence that you are no fool.

OLIVIA  How say you to that, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO  I marvel your Ladyship takes delight in
such a barren rascal. I saw him put down the other
day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion to
him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men
that crow so at these set kind of Fools no better than
the Fools' zanies.

OLIVIA  O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless,
and of free disposition is to take those things
for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There
is no slander in an allowed Fool, though he do
nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
man, though he do nothing but reprove.

FOOL  Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
speak'st well of Fools!


MARIA  Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman
much desires to speak with you.

OLIVIA  From the Count Orsino, is it?

MARIA  I know not, madam. 'Tis a fair young man, and
well attended.

OLIVIA  Who of my people hold him in delay?

MARIA  Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.

OLIVIA  Fetch him off, I pray you. He speaks nothing
but madman. Fie on him! [Maria exits.] Go you,
Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick,
or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it. [(Malvolio
exits.)] Now you see, sir, how your fooling
grows old, and people dislike it.

FOOL  Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
son should be a Fool, whose skull Jove cram with
brains, for--here he comes--one of thy kin has a
most weak pia mater.

[Enter Sir Toby.]

OLIVIA  By mine honor, half drunk!--What is he at the
gate, cousin?

TOBY  A gentleman.

OLIVIA  A gentleman? What gentleman?

TOBY  'Tis a gentleman here--a plague o' these pickle
herring!--How now, sot?

FOOL  Good Sir Toby.

OLIVIA  Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by
this lethargy?

TOBY  Lechery? I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.

OLIVIA  Ay, marry, what is he?

TOBY  Let him be the devil an he will, I care not. Give
me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.	[He exits.]

OLIVIA  What's a drunken man like, Fool?

FOOL  Like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman. One
draught above heat makes him a fool, the second
mads him, and a third drowns him.

OLIVIA  Go thou and seek the crowner and let him sit o'
my coz, for he's in the third degree of drink: he's
drowned. Go look after him.

FOOL  He is but mad yet, madonna, and the Fool shall
look to the madman.	[He exits.]


MALVOLIO  Madam, yond young fellow swears he will
speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes
on him to understand so much, and therefore
comes to speak with you. I told him you were
asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that
too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is
to be said to him, lady? He's fortified against any
denial.

OLIVIA  Tell him he shall not speak with me.

MALVOLIO  Has been told so, and he says he'll stand at
your door like a sheriff's post and be the supporter
to a bench, but he'll speak with you.

OLIVIA  What kind o' man is he?

MALVOLIO  Why, of mankind.

OLIVIA  What manner of man?

MALVOLIO  Of very ill manner. He'll speak with you,
will you or no.

OLIVIA  Of what personage and years is he?

MALVOLIO  Not yet old enough for a man, nor young
enough for a boy--as a squash is before 'tis a
peascod, or a codling when 'tis almost an apple. 'Tis
with him in standing water, between boy and man.
He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly.
One would think his mother's milk were
scarce out of him.

Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.

MALVOLIO  Gentlewoman, my lady calls.	[He exits.]


Give me my veil. Come, throw it o'er my face.
[Olivia veils.]
We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.

[Enter Viola.]

VIOLA  The honorable lady of the house, which is she?

OLIVIA  Speak to me. I shall answer for her. Your will?

VIOLA  Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable
beauty--I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the
house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast
away my speech, for, besides that it is excellently
well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
beauties, let me sustain no scorn. I am very comptible
even to the least sinister usage.

OLIVIA  Whence came you, sir?

VIOLA  I can say little more than I have studied, and
that question's out of my part. Good gentle one,
give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the
house, that I may proceed in my speech.

OLIVIA  Are you a comedian?

VIOLA  No, my profound heart. And yet by the very
fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play. Are
you the lady of the house?

OLIVIA  If I do not usurp myself, I am.

VIOLA  Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to
reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on
with my speech in your praise and then show you
the heart of my message.

OLIVIA  Come to what is important in 't. I forgive you
the praise.

VIOLA  Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis
poetical.

OLIVIA  It is the more like to be feigned. I pray you,
keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and
allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than
to hear you. If you be not mad, begone; if you have
reason, be brief. 'Tis not that time of moon with me
to make one in so skipping a dialogue.

MARIA  Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.

VIOLA  No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little
longer.--Some mollification for your giant, sweet

OLIVIA  Tell me your mind.

VIOLA  I am a messenger.

OLIVIA  Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver
when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your

VIOLA  It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture
of war, no taxation of homage. I hold the olive in
my hand. My words are as full of peace as matter.

OLIVIA  Yet you began rudely. What are you? What
would you?

VIOLA  The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
learned from my entertainment. What I am and
what I would are as secret as maidenhead: to your
ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation.

OLIVIA  Give us the place alone. We will hear this
divinity. [Maria and Attendants exit.] Now, sir, what
is your text?

VIOLA  Most sweet lady--

OLIVIA  A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said
of it. Where lies your text?

VIOLA  In Orsino's bosom.

OLIVIA  In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?

VIOLA  To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.

OLIVIA  O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more
to say?

VIOLA  Good madam, let me see your face.

OLIVIA  Have you any commission from your lord to
negotiate with my face? You are now out of your
text. But we will draw the curtain and show you the
picture. [She removes her veil.] Look you, sir, such a
one I was this present. Is 't not well done?

VIOLA  Excellently done, if God did all.

OLIVIA  'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and
weather.

'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on.
Lady, you are the cruel'st she alive
If you will lead these graces to the grave
And leave the world no copy.

OLIVIA  O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted! I will give
out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be
inventoried and every particle and utensil labeled
to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item,
two gray eyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one
chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise

I see you what you are. You are too proud.
But if you were the devil you are fair.
My lord and master loves you. O, such love
Could be but recompensed though you were
crowned
The nonpareil of beauty.

OLIVIA  How does he love me?

VIOLA  With adorations, fertile tears,
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.

Your lord does know my mind. I cannot love him.
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant,
And in dimension and the shape of nature
A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.
He might have took his answer long ago.

If I did love you in my master's flame,
With such a suff'ring, such a deadly life,
In your denial I would find no sense.
I would not understand it.

OLIVIA  Why, what would you?

Make me a willow cabin at your gate
And call upon my soul within the house,
Write loyal cantons of contemned love
And sing them loud even in the dead of night,
Hallow your name to the reverberate hills
And make the babbling gossip of the air
Cry out "Olivia!" O, you should not rest
Between the elements of air and earth
But you should pity me.

OLIVIA  You might do much.
What is your parentage?

Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.
I am a gentleman.

OLIVIA  Get you to your lord.
I cannot love him. Let him send no more--
Unless perchance you come to me again
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well.
I thank you for your pains. Spend this for me.

I am no fee'd post, lady. Keep your purse.
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,
And let your fervor, like my master's, be
Placed in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.	[She exits.]

OLIVIA  "What is your parentage?"
"Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.
I am a gentleman." I'll be sworn thou art.
Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit
Do give thee fivefold blazon. Not too fast! Soft,
soft!
Unless the master were the man. How now?
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
With an invisible and subtle stealth
To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.--
What ho, Malvolio!


MALVOLIO  Here, madam, at your service.

Run after that same peevish messenger,
The County's man. He left this ring behind him,
Would I or not. Tell him I'll none of it.
[She hands him a ring.]
Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
Nor hold him up with hopes. I am not for him.
If that the youth will come this way tomorrow,
I'll give him reasons for 't. Hie thee, Malvolio.

MALVOLIO  Madam, I will.	[He exits.]

I do I know not what, and fear to find
Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
Fate, show thy force. Ourselves we do not owe.
What is decreed must be, and be this so.

  She says, "'Tis so," they answer all, "'Tis so,"
  And would say after her if she said "No."

Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,
From his moist cabinet mounts up on high
And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast
The sun ariseth in his majesty,
  Who doth the world so gloriously behold
  That cedar tops and hills seem burnished gold.

Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:
"O thou clear god and patron of all light,
From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
The beauteous influence that makes him bright,
  There lives a son that sucked an earthly mother
  May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other."

This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,
Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,
And yet she hears no tidings of her love;
She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn.
  Anon she hears them chant it lustily,
  And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.

And as she runs, the bushes in the way
Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,
Some twined about her thigh to make her stay.
She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,
  Like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache,
  Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.

By this she hears the hounds are at a bay,
Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder
Wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way,
The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;
  Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
  Appalls her senses and her spirit confounds.

For now she knows it is no gentle chase,
But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,
Because the cry remaineth in one place,
Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud.
  Finding their enemy to be so curst,
  They all strain court'sy who shall cope him first.

This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,
Through which it enters to surprise her heart,
Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,
With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part.
  Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield,
  They basely fly and dare not stay the field.

Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,
Till, cheering up her senses all dismayed,
She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy
And childish error that they are afraid,
  Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more--
  And with that word she spied the hunted boar,

Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,
Like milk and blood being mingled both together,
A second fear through all her sinews spread,
Which madly hurries her she knows not whither;
  This way she runs, and now she will no further
  But back retires to rate the boar for murder.

A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways;
She treads the path that she untreads again;
Her more than haste is mated with delays,
Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,
  Full of respects, yet naught at all respecting,
  In hand with all things, naught at all effecting.

Here kenneled in a brake she finds a hound
And asks the weary caitiff for his master,
And there another licking of his wound,
'Gainst venomed sores the only sovereign plaster,
  And here she meets another, sadly scowling,
  To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.

When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,
Another flapmouthed mourner, black and grim,
Against the welkin volleys out his voice;
Another and another answer him,
  Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,
  Shaking their scratched ears, bleeding as they go.

Look how the world's poor people are amazed
At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,
Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,
Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;
  So she at these sad signs draws up her breath
  And, sighing it again, exclaims on Death.

"Hard-favored tyrant, ugly, meager, lean,
Hateful divorce of love!"--thus chides she Death--
"Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean
To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,
  Who, when he lived, his breath and beauty set
  Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?

"If he be dead--O no, it cannot be,
Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it!
O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see,
But hatefully at random dost thou hit.
  Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart
  Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart.

"Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,
And hearing him, thy power had lost his power.
The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower.
  Love's golden arrow at him should have fled,
  And not Death's ebon dart to strike him dead.

"Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok'st such weeping?
What may a heavy groan advantage thee?
Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?
  Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigor
  Since her best work is ruined with thy rigor."

Here overcome as one full of despair,
She vailed her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopped
The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
In the sweet channel of her bosom dropped;
  But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,
  And with his strong course opens them again.

O, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!
Her eye seen in the tears, tears in her eye,
Both crystals, where they viewed each other's sorrow,
Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;
  But, like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,
  Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.

Variable passions throng her constant woe
As striving who should best become her grief;
All entertained, each passion labors so
That every present sorrow seemeth chief,
  But none is best; then join they all together
  Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.
